<p>The following Report contains a summary of investigations
of a Committee, appointed by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, at York, in 1881, to consist
of Professor Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, Mr. John
Cordeaux, Mr. Philip M. C. Kermode, Mr. J. Hardy, Mr. R. M.
Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining
(with the consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the
Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and
the Commissioners of Irish Lights) observations on the
Migration of Birds at lighthouses and lightships, and of
reporting upon the same at Southampton in 1882. Mr.
Cordeaux to be the Secretary.</p>

<p>An abstract of the Report was read by Mr. Philip
M. C. Kermode at the meeting of the Association, held at
Southampton, in August, 1882.</p>

<p>The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged
by Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown; for the East Coast of
England, by Mr. Cordeaux; the West Coast of England,
by Mr. Kermode; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by
Mr. R. M. Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More.</p>

<p>Iceland and Faroe.&mdash;Schedules, &amp;c., were, as before, forwarded
to Iceland and Faroe. Returns have come from Faroe,
the results of which I prefer to keep under a separate heading,
as they usually come in when the rest of the Report is well
advanced.</p>

<p>Of <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> there is one record on May 13th, when one
Wheatear was seen on board the 'Arcturus,' thirty miles east of
the Orkney Isles. Of <i>Hirundinid&aelig;</i>, one seen at Thorshavn on
May 22nd. Of <i>Otid&aelig;</i>, one Long-eared Owl was seen at Vivalvig,
Str&oacute;m&oacute;, on June 27th. Of <i>Ardeid&aelig;</i>, one Night Heron, <i>Nycticorax
griseus</i> (Linn.), was killed at Videreijde on May 4th. In autumn
several Turtle Doves, <i>Columba Turtur</i>, were seen, and one shot
at N&oacute;ls&oacute; on Sept. 7th. Of <i>Rallid&aelig;</i>, one Water Rail was killed in
the hospital garden, at Thorshavn, on Oct. 31st. Of Larid&aelig;, one
Pomatorhine Skua (young), was killed near Kirkeb&oacute; on Oct. 26th.
Of <span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;</span>, one Coot, <i>Fulica atra</i>, was shot at N&oacute;ls&oacute; on Nov. 8th.</p>

<p>The winds prevailing at the time of the above records for the
most part southerly and easterly in Faroe, but on May 13th and
22nd southerly and westerly, and also S.W. on Nov. 8th.</p>

<p>The usual papers were sent to twenty-six stations, as before.
With Iceland, Faroe and Fair Isle we have on this line thirty
stations in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">-2-</span></p>

<p>Twelve stations on the East Coast of Scotland returned
filled-in schedules, against eight last year&mdash;1880&mdash;out of the
twenty-six. Many of these returns are very light, but those
from Isle of May, Bell Rock and Pentland Skerries are unusually
full, showing great highways of migration, and also that from
Sumburgh Head. We shall have more to say on this in our
general remarks at the end of the Report.</p>

<p>The stations are as follows, commencing in the north. The
dates upon which the various stations have sent in returns are
shown in the list by the positions of the asterisks preceding the
consecutive numbers. The work done compares favourably with
that of 1880, but we receive as yet only twelve returns from
twenty-six stations; however short, others will be acceptable,
even if only negative information.</p>

<p>Those sending no returns have not in all cases given reasons.
Attention to this is earnestly requested (vide 2nd Report, p. 2).</p>

<p>The numbers are the same as in the 2nd Report, 1880, but
another for Fair Isle has been inserted as "7B."</p>

<p>Notes received from other sources will appear, as before,
after the paragraphs on each species, as it is desirable to keep
the two sets of observations distinct. I would also refer here to
my "Third Report on Scottish Ornithology," already referred to
in 'Migration Report, 1880,' p. 4, as having been read, but not
yet printed (Feb. 1882).</p>

<p>Notes have been kept upon about 25 species of waterfowl and
about 50 species of land birds by our reporters on the east coast.
Spring migration I have not kept distinct in this Report.
Obituary at each station, inappreciable at Scottish stations,
will be noticed where necessary under General Remarks.</p>

<p>Owing to Mr. T. Anderson having been almost entirely
sailing to and fro in the Mediterranean, I regret that I can show
no returns this year from Mid-Atlantic, which is to be regretted,
as it would be instructive to learn what are the results of a contrary
prevailing wind to that of 1880. Possibly, however, Mr.
R. Gray may yet be able to give us some returns of interest
culled from the Mediterranean log, which may raise other points

<p><a id="Notes"></a>The following short notes on weather are compiled from the
'Times' Register for 1881, and checked by my own schedules:&mdash;A
sudden change of temperature at the beginning of August,
colder by about two degrees than July. Rainfall excessive over
all Scotland, except northern half where it was less than average;
cold and wet all August, about six degrees colder than corresponding
period of 1880. Prevailing wind W., seldom veering
to E., until Aug. 23rd; thereafter in Scotland prevailing E. and
N.E.; on Aug. 31st N. winds prevailed, N.E., and continued till
about Sept. 6th; thereafter W. and N.W. till 16th; then S. and
S.E. till 21st; from 22nd to 24th E.; 24th to 30th S. to W.;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">-4-</span>
Oct. 1st to 10th S.; 10th to 13th strong W.; 14th gale from E.,
and continued E. and S.E. to end of month. S.E. to S. strong
winds and gales, or light from Nov. 1st to 11th; S.W. strong
and a gale 15th and 16th; frost on 17th; 22nd S. to S.W. and
W., heavy gales in N. and W. Unsettled, with frequent changes
of wind and weather, many W. gales till end of month, and till
Dec. 8th. N. and E. on both coasts from Dec. 9th to 12th, S.
on 13th, and S. and W. on 14th; S. and W. till 20th, when E.;
and W.N.W. on 21st. Prevailing W. and S.W. till end of month.</p>

<p><i>Notes.</i>&mdash;Prevailing winds at the time of the rush of <i>Falconid&aelig;</i>
were W., veering from S.W. to N.W. in Aug.; after 23rd E.;
on and after Aug. 31st till Sept. 6th N. At XIV., on Aug. 19th,
a Sparrowhawk was seen sitting on the ground, and almost daily
for some time after. The nearest breeding-place I know of is at
Tongue, N. Sutherland; wind at the time was light S., and
weather clear. No doubt it is difficult to discriminate often
between local and general migrations of Hawks by our data; thus
at XIV. also, on Aug. 23rd and 24th, a Sparrowhawk was seen
flying south on the former date, and N.E. on the latter; on the
former date the wind was light S., on the latter N.E.; this would
therefore appear like a local migration.</p>

<p>The only addition to the list of stations is Fair Isle, No. 7 b.</p>

<p>In all spring records the numbers of stations begin at the
most southerly, or with the higher numbers. In all autumn
records the numbers of stations begin at the most northerly, or
with the lower numbers. The maximum station, or station
sending most returns of the species, is indicated when thought
necessary.</p>

<p><a id="Turdidae"></a><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Records at Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, Girdleness, Bell Rock, and Isle of May (maximum).
Earliest at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd; latest at Sumburgh Head,
Dec. 8th. Rushes at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd to 30th (see notes
<i>infra</i>); also Oct. 20th. Redwings and female Blackbirds migrating
between 14th and 24th. Great S.E. gale on 14th. At
Pentland Skerries, Fieldfares, Thrushes, and Blackbirds, Nov.
5th and 6th, flying N.E. all day; also smaller rushes at Sumburgh
Head, Dec. 1st to 8th. Time of day: Mostly daytime, but
night of 13th to 14th at Bell Pock. "Storm burst at 10.10 a.m.
on 14th." Notes: A great rush of migrants took place at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">-5-</span>
date of 22nd to 23rd Sept. at Isle of May (station 27), but no
corresponding rush is recorded at Bell Rock (station 26). At
Isle of May it continued all day. The weather was thick haze,
approaching to fog, with a continuous downpour of rain; wind
S.E. "All the birds seen to-day appeared perfectly bewildered."
The following species occurred on 22nd alone: Thrushes, Redstarts,
one Robin, one Blue-throated Warbler (<i>C. Wolfi</i>),
Swallows, Chaffinches, one Nightjar (the first ever captured
or seen here, and sent to me along with the Blue-throated
Warbler and others), one Corn Crake (seldom seen here). Golden
Plovers (large flock), Ringed Plovers, Lapwings, "rush" of
Curlews, two Snipe, Sandpipers and Waders, and Dunlins. This
great migration continued more or less all the latter part of
September at this locality, during which time there appeared
Yellow Buntings, Bramblings, Wheatears (or Stonechats), Pipits,
and Wagtails; numbers of Robins on 23rd. N.B. Later in the
report under these species I will refer back to this note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring: Bell Rock, and Whalsey Skerries.
Wheatears. Earliest at Bell Rock, April 14th; latest at Bell
Rock, May 2nd. Rush on May 2nd, at Bell Rock. General
Notes:&mdash;Accompanied by many other species not recognised; on
that day also a large bird struck, rebounded, and fell into sea.&mdash;Autumn:
Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries,
Bell Rock, Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Wheatears. Earliest
at Sumburgh Head, Aug. 14th; latest at Pentland Skerries,
Sept. 30th. Rushes scarcely appreciable, Aug. 22nd and 28th,
at Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, and Pentland Skerries;
and Sept. 24th and 30th, at Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and
Inch Keith. Rushes at Pentland Skerries on several dates.
Besides Wheatears, Redstarts. Earliest at Isle of May, Aug.
22nd; latest at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd. Whinchats (or Blue
Janets), also at Isle of May, Sept. 21st. Prevailing winds E.
and S.E. General Notes (see under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring: Robins at Cromarty and Montroseness;
only two records. Earlier at Cromarty, March 20th, but left
same date; later at Montroseness, April 14th, flying about rock.&mdash;Autumn:
Tarbat Ness, Cromarty, and Isle of May. Robins.
Earliest at Cromarty, Sept. 16th, and were the first seen since
March 6th (see Spring); latest seen Dec. 15th. At Tarbat Ness
first seen Oct. 10th. Rush Sept. 22nd and 23rd, at Isle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">-6-</span>
May (see Notes under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>); also Oct. 21st, at Isle of
May ("appear to be very small specimens.") Mr. Agnew preserved
one for me in spirits on Dec. 15th, but whether one of
these small specimens I cannot as yet say. N.B. Spanish
examples are known to be very much smaller than British (<i>vide</i>
Howard Saunders and H. E. Dresser).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Gold Crests at Sumburgh Head,
Tarbat Ness, and Isle of May. Earliest at Tarbat Ness, Sept.
10th (two seen); latest at Isle of May, Sept. 27th. Rush, a
small one, Oct. 24th, 25th, and 27th, at Isle of May. General
Remarks:&mdash;Mr. Agnew says, "I expect more," but no more
appeared in his later schedules. A general movement of this
species appreciable also about Sept. 10th to 18th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Tit. One record at Isle of May, April
23rd. General Remark:&mdash;One alighted on lantern at 11 p.m.&mdash;Autumn:
Tits at Pentland Skerries and Inch Keith. Earliest
at Inch Keith, Aug. 5th (a number at night); latest at Pentland
Skerries, Oct. 6th (one all day). Another struck N.W. side of
lantern of Inch Keith on night of 5th to 6th. General Remarks:&mdash;Aug.
5th, at Inch Keith (as above), "earlier than usual."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Common Wren. One record from
Isle of May, March 19th.&mdash;Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest at Sumburgh Head, Aug.
3rd (left); latest at Pentland Skerries, Nov. 16th. Others Oct.
6th and 8th. Rush (inappreciable) on these later dates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Bell Rock and Isle of May (only two).
Wagtails. Earliest at Isle of May, March 12th; latest at Bell
Rock, April 13th. General Remarks:&mdash;The latter "running
over the rocks, but leaving at high tide, as all birds do that land
upon these rocks" (J. Agnew).&mdash;Autumn: Pentland Skerries and
Isle of May (three records). Wagtails. Earliest at Pentland
Skerries (three all day), when a gale from N., Aug. 27th; latest
at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, "when a few new-comers, having
more white upon them than the few residents, appeared." Also
occurred at Pentland Skerries, Sept. 10th. Pipits at Whalsey
Skerries, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May (few records).
Earliest at Whalsey Skerries, Aug. 28th (following Sparrowhawk),
but all left next day; latest at Pentland Skerries, Oct. 25th (six
struck at night). Rush (on small scale) at Isle of May, Sept.
24th, 25th, and 26th. General Notes:&mdash;Mr. Agnew speaks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span>
some being always here, but additions on Sept. 24th. Possibly
Mr. Agnew alludes, however, to Rock Pipits as the residents.
The Meadow Pipit is probably the species first seen as additions
on Sept. 24th. N.B. The Rock Pipit is a larger bird than the
Meadow Pipit; please shoot one of the "resident birds" and
then one of the "additions," and if carefully compared, I think
Mr. Agnew will detect the difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Cromarty, Auskerry, Sumburgh
Head, and Whalsey Skerries. First arrivals at Auskerry, May
1st (Martins and Swallows remained three days and then left);
latest, at Whalsey Skerries, June 27th (a few flying about).
Rush hardly perceptible. General Notes:&mdash;At Sumburgh Head
four pairs all summer; all disappeared on night of July 20th.
That night one pair slept on the staircase-window.&mdash;Autumn:
Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries,
Cromarty, and Isle of May (a number). Earliest (see remarks
under Spring Migration, <i>supra</i>, July 20th); latest at Sumburgh
Head, Oct. 1st (one seen). No great rush appreciable, but flocks
of Swallows and Martins seen at Auskerry Aug. 1st and 4th, and
on 1st at Isle of May (one found dead previous night after heavy
gales); (see Notes under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>, <i>supra</i>) part of a general rush
of migrants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Isle of May, Bell Rock, Sumburgh
Head (considerable movement). Linnets. Earliest at Isle of
May, March 4th (asleep all night on doorway): two green Linnets.
Latest at Isle of May, April 14th (seen). General Notes:&mdash;Two
days previous "considerable number of Chaffinches, which
are very unusual at this season; also one Bullfinch." From a
remark of Mr. Agnew, that some of the latter breed on Isle of
May, I suspect these "Linnets" will prove to be Twites or
Mountain Linnets, <i>Linota flavirostris ?</i> These Linnets are also
noted at Bell Rock on April 10th, and at Sumburgh Head on
March 7th.&mdash;Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Isle of May, and Inch
Keith (large movement). Earliest (Grey Linnets) at Isle of May,
Aug. 18th (mostly young, apparently in broods, in large numbers);
latest at Sumburgh Head, Jan. 14th, 1882 (three seen).
Rushes (Chaffinches) at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd to 26th (see
Notes under <span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span>). Brambling also on 24th (one sent me
for identification). Siskin at Inch Keith, Sept. 25th. [General
Notes:&mdash;A desultory migration, kept up of Linnets and Siskins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span>
(which are rare on the Isle of May), occurred Oct. 4th and 5th.
A Redpole on 8th, at Sumburgh Head.] A rush between Oct.
20th and 27th at Isle of May, during which time Redpoles (20th
and 24th), Chaffinches (22nd), Bramblings (21st), one Siskin
(27th), and Grey Linnets or Twites (24th), at Sumburgh
Head; about fifty, along with ten Larks (see <a href="#Alaudidae"><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;</span></a>.).
Occasional birds seen at Isle of May:&mdash;Nov. 12th, one Siskin;
28th, one hen Linnet; and on Nov. 21st, at Inch Keith, one
Siskin. On Dec. 3rd, at Isle of May, one Redpole, preserved
in spirits (<i>vide infra</i>), and one Brambling, same time and
place. On the 4th, Green Linnets at Sumburgh Head, and in
Jan., 1882 (latest), three Green Linnets on 14th. In Shetland
prevailing winds during the winter were from S.W., "and consequently
no strange birds visited us." A flock of Mealy Redpoles
arrived at Lerwick, and took up their abode for a time in Mr.
P. T. Garrick's garden, at Prospect House. This movement
doubtless belongs to the Spring Migration of 1882. In August
unusually large flocks of Greenfinches were observed by Mr.
Service near Dumfries; left after two weeks, and reappeared
in January, 1882.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Isle of May and Bell Rock. Earliest
at Bell Rock, March 17th (one "Snowflake" flying from N.W. to
S.E.); latest (and only other spring record) at Isle of May,
April 9th (three "Mountain Sparrows" identified as Snow
Buntings).&mdash;Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, Dunnet Head, Tarbat Ness, Isle of May, and Inch
Keith, Snow Buntings, numerous records, and reported as
unusually plentiful at many stations. Earliest at Isle of May,
Sept. 24th, where, Mr. Agnew writes, "they are never plentiful";
latest, Dec. 10th to Jan. 28th, at Isle of May. Rushes at
Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and
Dunnet Head, Sept. 20th to 25th (note migration of other species
at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd&mdash;see notes under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>). Rushes
spasmodical, at different places, on different dates. Rush Dec.
3rd to 21st; after, stragglers (<i>i.e.</i>, flocks of forty or fifty).&mdash;Weather:
In October winds S. and N.W., at Sumburgh Head, to
fresh E. and N., cloudy, clear, or showery. In November S. gale
on 4th at Pentland Skerries. Calm or N. on 9th, S.S.W. or S.
on 14th, and on 17th S. or N. December variable from light
S.W. at Isle of May to fresh N.E. and S.E., light W. and light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
S.W. Besides Snow Buntings, a flock of about 250 Common
Buntings are reported from Sumburgh Head on Nov. 6th ("a
compact flock"), at 10 a.m.</p>

<p><a id="Alaudidae"></a><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: A spring rush is reported at Bell Rock
between Feb. 5th and 25th; or possibly this may only belong to
migration of 1880. Great numbers of Larks mixed with Rose
Linnets, Starlings, and other species, from 2 to 5 a.m.; great
numbers struck; wind on arrival light S.W., on departure fresh
N.E., fog and rain. Feb. 18th, great numbers, all Larks, greatly
exhausted, seen asleep, and others struck, but none found dead;
wind light E.S.E., haze. On 19th, "small birds, not recognised,
flew about for an hour, and left at dawn"; and on 25th great
numbers, all Larks, much exhausted, at 1.30 a.m.; left after an
hour's rest at dawn, flying N.W.&mdash;Autumn: Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May (numerous).
Earliest at Sumburgh Head, Sept. 15th (breeds here, but left
to-day); latest at Isle of May, Dec. 1st (two seen). Rushes
at Isle of May, Sept. 24th; numbers on 25th and 26th,
increased up to 27th; also at Pentland Skerries (accompanying
Wheatears); also fewer on Sept. 15th, 16th, and 18th. Rush
at Pentland Skerries, striking all night, Oct. 26th; stragglers
on 1st and 8th.&mdash;Weather: Fresh S. wind Sept. 1st to 8th, to
fresh S.E. and clear on 26th. Nov. 24th, at Sumburgh Head
(along with Grey Linnets), fresh S., cloudy; and Dec. 1st, at
Isle of May, two seen, as above recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet
Head, and Isle of May. Unusually few, but all about same time.
Earliest at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, Oct. 20th and
21st; latest at Dunnet Head, Jan. 15th, 1882 (date of return of
schedule). General Notes:&mdash;Resident all winter at many localities
as at Auskerry ("all winter"). The scarcity of the Starling on
migration this autumn is noteworthy (<i>vide</i> conditions of wind
and weather as compared with other years).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Spring: Bell Rock and Isle of May. Earliest at
Bell Rock, March 10th (seen on balcony-rail); latest, "five
Rooks," at Bell Rock, flying about. May 1st. Rush (apparently,
April 12th and 13th) at Bell Rock (Black Crows and a good many
"Grey Crows" with them). On 16th, three Rooks flying N.&mdash;Autumn:
Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May.
Earliest July 15th, at Pentland Skerries (mixed with Jackdaws);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span>
remained till middle of August, and then disappeared; latest
Nov. 10th, two Ravens at Pentland Skerries, flying W., but no
Rooks after Aug. 15th. Ravens also at Pentland Skerries, July
29th. Hooded Crows. Earliest Sept. 14th, at Pentland Skerries;
latest on Nov. 5th, at Pentland Skerries. Rush on Oct.
2nd, at Isle of May (large numbers).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Autumn: Only records at Sumburgh Head.
Earliest Sept. 13th, five seen at 6 p.m., light N.W. airs, clear;
next record Sept. 16th, one seen, light W., clear; latest Sept.
27th, one, light S.W., haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caprimulgid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Autumn: Only one record at Isle of May,
where the first was observed, Sept. 26th, along with a great Rush
of other migrants (see Notes under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>, <i>antea</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Records at Auskerry and Isle of May.
Earliest Aug. 25th, when one "Grey Owl" seen at Isle of May,
fresh E., heavy rain, and haze; latest Dec. 19th, one reddish
brown Owl, at 1 p.m., S.W., clear, at same station. Other dates,
Oct. 15th to 18th, two Owls stayed three days, arriving at
4 p.m. on 15th, leaving at 4 p.m. on 18th, at Auskerry, N.W.
gale, showers, and haze. Also Oct. 24th, one "light brown"
Owl at Isle of May, S.S.E., showery; also Nov. 28rd, one seen
at Isle of May, 3 p.m., S.W., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, and Bell Rock (all insular). Earliest July
28th, at Whalsey Skerries, one Hawk flying N.; latest Dec. 14th,
at Isle of May, two "large Hawks." Rush in August and September,
at Bell Rock, from which I have twenty-two returns in
that time; never so many seen here before. Kestrels, principally
at Isle of May, till Aug. 18th; latest Sept. 25th. Sparrowhawk.
A rush at Pentland Skerries between Aug. 19th and 28th, or the
same birds reappearing: all seen during the daytime, along with
all other Hawks. Merlin, one on Sept. 22nd, at Sumburgh
Head; another on Oct. 11th, feeding, on Snow Buntings, shot;
other two seen. Falcon, one seen flying S.W., at Pentland
Skerries, on Oct. 10th. Buzzards one (by description) flying S.
at Isle of May, Sept. 27th. "Large Brown Hawks," or simply
"Hawks," occurring principally at Isle of May. A rush between
Sept. 6th and 19th, with E. winds (see <a href="#Notes">General Notes</a> on weather).
A great rush of Hawks, Eagles, &amp;c., took place all over the
country at the latter end of September. Amongst others the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span>
following are recorded:&mdash;Ospreys, Harriers, Common and Honey
Buzzards. Especially Fifeshire is noted (<i>vide</i> 'Field,' Oct. 8th,
1881, p. 514). Rough-legged Buzzards are recorded from
localities in Forfar, Perth, and Stirlingshire, at similar stations
as they usually appear at when their migration takes place, <i>i. e.</i>,
along almost precisely the same lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelicanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn: Records from Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 1st, Gannets
pass Pentland Skerries daily in flocks of twelve to forty, or
singly, and continue till middle of September, which is the latest
record I have. Rush past Pentland Skerries appears to have
been on Aug. 19th, when 2300 were counted between daylight
and dark, flying chiefly E., and very few going W. On Aug. 4th
large numbers at 2 p.m., at Sumburgh Head, fresh breeze,
cloudy. At this station Gannets are noted as very scarce all
summer, owing, it is believed, to scarcity of herrings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring: Only one Heron recorded at Whalsey
Skerries, on May 29th, 8 p.m., S.E. light airs, clear; fog from
N.W. after 11 p.m.&mdash;Autumn: Records at Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 16th, at
Sumburgh Head, flying N., chased by Gulls, light E. airs;
latest Nov. 24th, at Isle of May, one seen, strong S.W., showers;
Rush Sept. 3rd to 6th, at Isle of May, during which time eight
were seen, all flying S., and four on the 5th, came from N.,
alighted and remained; wind on 3rd fresh E., and haze; on 5th
fresh N.E., clear; and on 6th light W., and haze (see Note, <i>infra</i>).
Rush also on Oct. 12th, 13th, and 14th, previous to gale of 14th,
but statistics scanty. All Herons seen at Isle of May almost
invariably fly S. Prevailing winds at Isle of May, W., till gale
on 14th from N.N.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wild Geese. Spring: Records at Whalsey
Skerries, Auskerry, and Isle of May. Earliest March 6th, at
Whalsey Skerries, eight resting on island for several days,
E. gale, and haze; latest April 21st, at Isle of May, large flock
flying E., accompanied by Curlews.&mdash;Autumn: Records at
Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries,
Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Earliest "Wild Geese," Oct. 2nd,
at Isle of May, thirteen flying W. in line. Earliest "Barnacle,"
only record, Aug. 12th, at Inch Keith, one flying due N.; latest
"Wild Geese," Dec. 23rd, at Isle of May. Immense flock flying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span>
N.E., 11.80 a.m., S.W., haze, approaching to fog; and another
flock same day, at 12.30 p.m. Besides the above, one "Brent"
Goose (?) is noted on Nov. 25th, flying N., with S.W. gale, and
showers. Swans.&mdash;Spring: Records at Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, and Bell Rock. Earliest Feb. 27th, at Sumburgh
Head, two "Wild Swans," apparently much fatigued, flying S.;
latest May 6th, a flock flying N.E. Autumn: Records at
Sumburgh Head. Earliest Nov. 12th, at Sumburgh Head,
eight flying S.E.; latest Dec. 25th, at Sumburgh Head, two
resting on a lock near the lighthouse, where they frequently rest
on their way south every year. Note:&mdash;If these are the same
birds each year, it is interesting as proving the undeviating lines
of autumn flight of waterfowl. Eider Ducks.&mdash;Spring: Whalsey
Skerries only; noted as arriving at breeding haunts on March
9th. Autumn: Records at Whalsey Skerries, Auskerry, Pentland
Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 5th, when Eiders
left the island at Whalsey Skerries. "The Drakes had left previously,"
light S., haze, and fog; latest Oct. 20th, at Auskerry,
ten Eiders remained all day; they also remain at Auskerry all
winter. Rush, largest number recorded at Pentland Skerries on
Oct. 8th, when a flock of 100, mostly males, were seen swimming
past the island, light S. breeze, and fog; and forty took shelter
on Oct. 12th, at 9 a.m., at Whalsey Skerries, S.W. gale and
rain; and all left next day. Sheldrake.&mdash;Autumn: Having
remained here (Auskerry) all summer since end of June, leave in
September or October. Records from Auskerry and Pentland
Skerries. Earliest Aug. 27th, at Pentland Skerries, one found
dead; latest Oct. 5th, at Pentland Skerries, flock flying S.E.
Other dates, Aug. 31st, at Pentland Skerries, flying S.; Sept.
3rd, flying about light, not striking. Teal.&mdash;One on Sept. 21st,
at Isle of May, another at Pentland Skerries, on Oct. 8th. Wild
Duck at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, Oct. 4th, and Nov. 21st. Long-tailed
Duck at Sumburgh Head, Nov. 12th (about twenty).
On Sept. 12th Tufted Ducks were abundant on Loch Leven,&mdash;the
most abundant species there,&mdash;and the young were not able
to fly, "some being not larger than a Water Rat." Other species
seen were Scaup, Golden-eye, Pochard, Teal, and Mallard (P. D.
Maloch, <i>in lit.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Corn Crake. Spring: One arrival noted at
Cromarty on May 19th. Autumn: One in. Isle of May, Sept.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">-13-</span>
22nd (seldom seen here; <i>vide</i> Notes under <span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span>); also Oct.
22nd, at Isle of May, and one at Pentland Skerries; the two
dates are both dates of rushes of other migrants. The Spotted
Crake has been recorded at several land stations, and found to
recur at several where it occurred before. Thus one at Aberuthven
Wood this season, and one at the same place three years ago
(P. D. Maloch, <i>in lit.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Golden Plover. Autumn: Whalsey Skerries,
Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head, and Isle of May.
Earliest Aug. 3rd, at Pentland Skerries; latest Dec. 23rd.

May; also on Oct. 17th and 18th, at Sumburgh Head and
Auskerry. Oystercatcher.&mdash;Spring: Arrived Feb. 24th at
breeding haunts on Whalsey Skerries; two recorded at Isle of
May, on April 12th. Autumn: Records mostly in August, at
Whalsey Skerries; left Whalsey Skerries on Aug. 26th; scattered
birds seen at Isle of May between 8th and 25th; three records.
Lapwing.&mdash;Spring: Arrivals in April 1st to 15th, at Whalsey
Skerries and Isle of May. Rushes about 1st and 11th, scarcely perceptible.
Autumn: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest
Aug. 27th, at Isle of May; latest Nov. 22nd. Rush past Isle of
May, Sept. 22nd; "large numbers," by description, flying high

Aug. 31st, at Isle of May, one rose off island and flew away S.;
latest Dec. 21st, at Isle of May, one seen. Rush scarcely
appreciable, but appeared also on Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May.
Records mostly of single birds; these two species exceedingly
scarce this autumn; severe winter of 1880-81 killed many, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">-14-</span>
severe spring interfered with breeding. "Sandpipers."&mdash;Autumn:
Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest Sept. 22nd, at Isle
of May, a number (see under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>); latest Dec. 17th, also

to an autumn movement (?); also at Cromarty, arrived on June
15th, left Aug. 20th. Terns appear irregular in hatching and
dates of leaving various stations; but most left all stations in
August, and recorded at Isle of May, passing S. Sept. 12th, 22nd,
and 28th. Kittiwakes arrived in spring, at Isle of May, March
12th; only other record, in autumn, Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May

13th; large white Gulls, wheeling round Isle of May, Aug. 25th;
Skuas (well described), Sept. 15th; and Oct. 19th and 29th, at
Pentland Skerries, where they are "very rare." Note:&mdash;Skuas,
Pomatorhine Skuas frequented the Hebrides most of the summer;
I (J. A. H. B.) saw several west of Lewes, and one near Island of
Rum in end of June. Iceland Gull.&mdash;A flight in December.
Earliest Dec. 1st, at Sumburgh Head; latest 28th, at same

and leave again." Second visit March 16th, at Isle of May;
arrived on third visit to breed, April 15th, but at Whalsey
Skerries not till 30th. N.B. Dates of arrival, and of preliminary
visits from all rock bird stations in Scotland, much desired by
committee. Autumn: All left Sumburgh Head on Aug. 6th;
all left Whalsey Skerries on Aug. 15th. Unusually large rush,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
flying S., passed Pentland Skerries on Nov. 12th; at this station
they pass almost daily, but this is date of general stampede.
Hundreds swimming round Isle of May on Dec. 15th, the latest
noted record here this year; and Mr. Agnew considers their
numbers at this late date quite unusual. Besides the 75 identified
species, or thereby, I have innumerable records of species which
cannot be recognised by description; and especially numerous
are the records from Isle of May, Mr. Agnew being very desirous
of learning more about them. He sent me numerous birds for
identification; amongst those not sent or recognised, two birds,
"never before seen," resemble a Cuckoo in every respect, but
smaller; others, called "Redtails" (? Redstarts), came in a flock
on June 3rd, and stayed till July 2nd. A great many entries
are simply "small birds" from Aug. 16th and 17th, and Sept.
14th to 30th. On Oct. 25th "a few more pretty birds, with red
breasts, forked tails, and two black stripes on head." On Oct.
27th, one "pure white down belly and round back, black spot a
little above tail, wings on top side a dun black, head and neck
same, red legs, bill like a Starling, size of a Plover." Again on
Nov. 2nd, two, "the general colour that of a Lark, same size,
three dark or black stripes down back, and one white feather
each side of tail." It is worthy of remark that these unknown
species struck most during easterly breezes (J. A. H. B.) I trust
another season to be better prepared to have some of these
identified. I have only mentioned them here to draw attention
to the fact that probably rare things, like the Blue-throated
Warbler (C Wolfi), may turn up. I might easily offer suggestions
as to what these unnamed are, but I do not think any practical
use would come by doing so.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>I have embodied all remarks on both coasts at the end of
the Report on the West Coast of Scotland, to which I refer
my readers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EAST_COAST_OF_ENGLAND">EAST COAST OF ENGLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p>Printed forms of enquiry and letters of instruction were sent
to thirty-four lighthouses and light-vessels on the east coast of
England, and two stations on the Channel Islands, thirty-six
altogether against thirty-seven in 1880, and returns have been
received from twenty-five.</p>

<p>Independent reports have also been sent in from Heligoland,
Seaton Carew and Redcar, Flamborough, Spurn, North-east
Lincolnshire, and Northrepps, making a total of thirty-two
reporting stations against thirty-eight in 1880.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to H. G&auml;tke, T. H. Nelson, C. Donald
Thompson, Matthew Bailey, William Eagle Clarke, H. Bendelack
Hewetson, M.D., J. H. Gurney, jun., Colonel Russell, and G. P.
Hope, for many interesting notes sent in, and for general kind
co-operation and assistance in the enquiry.</p>

<p>Special thanks is also given to the various observers on the
lighthouses and light-vessels whose names are given in the
Report; and it is to be regretted that no less than eleven stations,
from causes unknown to the writer, have failed to make returns,
more especially as some of these were amongst the best returning
stations in 1880. It is much to be hoped that this year the
returns will be more numerous and complete.</p>

<p>The east coast stations are as follows, those making returns
being marked with a star (*):&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption3nb">SEPARATE REPORT ON EACH SPECIES.</p>

<p>Song Thrush, <i>Turdus musicus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring migration
observed at one station only on the east coast. May 2nd, some
seen at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, with Blackbirds and one King Ouzel,
E.N.E., mist and rain. In the autumn occurred at the majority
of stations from Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> to Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, off Guernsey:
earliest date Nov. 2nd, at Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, several round
lanterns during night with Larks and Starlings; latest, Nov.
30th, Heligoland, passing all day with Fieldfares. Greatest
number occurred between Oct. 18th and 23rd at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
Flamborough Head <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, and Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, wind E.S.E., S.
Migration extended over about two months, line of flight
generally E. to W.</p>

<p>Redwing, <i>Tardus iliacus</i>, Linn.&mdash;First at Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on
August 1st, 3 a.m., five killed; last at Inner Farne, Nov. 1st, all
day with Thrushes. Great rush, Oct. 18th to 22nd. Migration
extending over three months.</p>

<p>Fieldfare, <i>Turdus pilaris</i>, Linn.&mdash;First, Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept.
14th, 1 p.m., fog and rain, two killed; last, Heligoland, Nov.
30th, great many passing; also same date at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
two flocks to W.N.W. Oct. 19th, at Teesmouth, before daybreak,
several were heard "chuckling" high overhead by
fishermen going out to sea, flying S.W. to W., wind E., strong
rain. The Fieldfare has been most exceptionally scarce on the
English coast during the autumn and winter.</p>

<p>White's Thrush, <i>Turdus varius</i>, Pall.&mdash;One early in January,
1882, at Waplington Manor, near Pocklington, Yorkshire.
(Zool., 1882, p. 74.)</p>

<p>Blackbird, <i>Turdus merula</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring migration observed
at Cromer on Jan. 29th (1881), 4 a.m., fog, two at lantern;
and also, Feb. 5th, six at midnight, three killed. At Inner
Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> they were seen in some numbers at 8 a.m., on May
22nd, with Thrushes. No Blackbirds crossed Heligoland in
the autumn. On English east coast they were noted at several
stations from Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on Oct. 2nd to the 28th at Hanois,
several striking there at 10 p.m. A great rush at several stations
from Oct. 21st to 25th inclusive, wind E.S.E., strong. During
the first week in November large numbers were observed in
North-east Lincolnshire, direction of flight E. to W. and S.W.,
and E.S.E. to N.W.</p>

<p>Ring Ouzel, <i>Turdus torquatus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, one,
May 2nd. In the autumn, at the same station, Oct. 3rd, one;
and at several stations from Oct. 23rd to 25th, when there was a
rush. None are recorded after this date, except one at Inner
Farne on Nov. 30th. Migrate like the rest of the Turdin&aelig;, both
by day and night, and in the same direction.</p>

<p>Common Wheatear, <i>Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i> (Linn.).&mdash;In spring of
1881, first at Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 25th, several all day, and
four days later at Inner Farne, 9 a.m., N.N.E. (four), snow,
several; many, same station, first week in May. In the autumn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
first at 5th Buoy, Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on Aug. 18th, great many, and subsequently,
up to end of first week in September, large numbers at
several stations observed passing along east coast southward.
At Spurn, on Sept. 14th, passed in thousands, and still far from
scarce on 17th. From Heligoland Mr. G&auml;tke reports, under date
Sept. 3rd:&mdash;"Numbers of small birds at the lighthouse from
3 a.m., at which hour the weather moderated with a change
from N.E. to E. by S.; all day multitudes of <i>ph&#339;nicurus</i>,
<i>trochilus</i>, <i>luctuosa</i>, <i>E. hortulana</i>, <i>A. arboreus</i> and <i>pratensis</i>,
<i>S. &#339;nanthe</i>. Night, from 3rd to 4th, great numbers of above
caught at lighthouse: among forty-nine <i>&#339;nanthe</i>, but three old;
amongst forty-seven <i>ph&#339;nicurus</i>, eleven old."&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Mem.</span> <i>Trochilus</i>
turned up after midnight; <i>ph&#339;nicurus</i> and <i>&#339;nanthe</i>, multitudes
of young males, early in the night (later also); but the few old
birds appeared later after midnight."&mdash;Spring migration, 1882,
March 19th, Spurn, several seen.</p>

<p>Whinchat, <i>Pratincola rubetra</i> (Linn.).&mdash;First week in September,
many, with Wheatears in the North-east Lincolnshire
marshes.</p>

<p>Stonechat, <i>Pratincola rubicola</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Great numbers at
Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on April 3rd. In the autumn, first on Northumberland
and Durham coast, Sept. 8th and 9th, and Spurn, Sept.
15th; last, at Inner Farne on Oct. 26th, E.S.E. (three), two
seen.</p>

<p>Redstart, <i>Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;The migration of the
Redstart seems so inseparably connected with that of the Wheatear
that it is difficult to disconnect the two. On May 1st one
killed at Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 11 p.m., S.W., o.m. In the autumn,
in August, September and October, at many stations, the main
body passing south in early part of September with the Wheatears.
On the 4th they were observed in great numbers along
the line of sandhills, near the entrance of the Humber, generally
young of the year, only four old males being seen. At Heligoland,
in August and first half of September, a great many
passed, and on 17th immense numbers; on 10th with <i>M. luctuosa</i>.
At Teesmouth (Redcar) a considerable flight came in on Sept.
22nd, during night or early morning, wind E., gales and very
stormy; all were young birds, males and females; last observed
at Inner Farne on Oct. 23rd, E.S.E. (seven). The latest immigrations
were associated with Redbreasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span></p>

<p>White-spotted Blue-throat, <i>Cyanecula leucocyana</i> (Brehm.)&mdash;On
Sept. 3rd an immature bird was shot by Mr. Power at Cley,
Norfolk. Another, also immature, is recorded by Mr. J. A.
Harvie Brown, in the Report from the east coast of Scotland,
captured at the Isle of May lighthouse on the night of Sept.
22nd.</p>

<p>Redbreast, <i>Erithacus rubecula</i> (Linn.).&mdash;March 5th, daybreak,
at Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, many Redbreasts. The first occurrence
in the autumn, September 5th, at the 5th Buoy, Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, when
one came on board. At the Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> large numbers
passed to W. with Wrens on Sept. 22nd. Same date, and to the
25th, many at the Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> Whitby on 20th. Also
occurring at several stations through October in considerable
numbers, as far south as the Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> Very large
numbers at Spurn, from October 2nd to 8th; on the 3rd so worn
out with a N.E. gale they might be caught by hand. Some
crossed Heligoland on Oct. 24th. Migration extending over two
months.</p>

<p>Whitethroat, <i>Sylvia rufa</i> (Bodd.); Lesser Whitethroat,
<i>S. curruca</i> (Linn.); Blackcap, <i>S. atricapilla</i> (Linn.); Garden
Warbler, <i>S. salicaria</i> (Linn.).&mdash;One common Whitethroat killed,
Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Feb. 21st, 1881, N.E. (4), o.m. Spurn, Sept.
3rd, Warblers of all kinds abounded. Greater and Lesser
Whitethroats, Blackcaps, and Garden Warblers:&mdash;At Teesmouth
(Redcar), Sept. 22nd, several, E. gale and rain. Spurn, one
male Blackcap on Oct. 8th. Some Whitethroats passed Heligoland
on Oct. 24th. On the English coast the migration of the
<i>Sylvian&aelig;</i> is carried on during August and September; the main
body passing south with great regularity in the first week in the
latter month.</p>

<p>Goldcrested Wren, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>, Koch.&mdash;Spring migration
on March 19th. Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, two killed against lanterns,
3 a.m., W. (four), b.c.m.; and at Hunstanton, April 14th, 2 a.m.,
one, with a Flycatcher, killed. In the autumn Goldcrests first

Whitethroats; several killed. Subsequently throughout October,
both by day and night, at stations from the Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> to
the Tongue <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, off the Thames. A great many Goldcrests
crossed Heligoland from Oct. 18th to 24th, E., clear, fine, but
fresh. The arrival of Goldcrests at Spurn as early as Sept. 5th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span>
associated as usual with Woodcocks and Short-eared Owls (three
widely separated species, which are, however, inseparably connected
in their migrations), is remarkable, as being one month
in advance of their average time. On the Suffolk coast, in great
numbers from Oct. 12th to 17th.</p>

<p>Willow Wren, <i>Phylloscopus trochilus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;At Spurn, last
week in August, immense numbers of Willow Wrens passed on

near lighthouse at time.</p>

<p>Common Wren, <i>Troglodytes parvulus</i>, Koch.&mdash;At Cromer,
night, April 9th, one killed against lantern. First at Flamborough
in the autumn; July 17th, several round lantern all
night, o.m.; the next notice is Aug. 12th. Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, from
noon to 2 p.m., large numbers with Redbreasts to W.N.W.
Aug, 21st, again at Flamborough, many round lantern all
night. Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 10 p.m., three killed, in company with other
small birds. Flamborough, Sept. 7th, again during the night,
many with Wheatears around lantern. At the Leman and
Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 22nd, large numbers during day, with Redbreasts,
to W. Last occurrence was Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 4th,

<p>Meadow Pipit, <i>Anthus pratensis</i> (Linn.).&mdash;April 15th, at the
Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, one, with a common Sparrow, came on board,
leaving again for W. In September large flocks continued to
arrive at intervals in North-east Lincolnshire, and pass on;
and again on the 13th, at Spurn, there was an extraordinary
migration going on all day from N. to S.</p>

<p>Tawny Pipit, <i>Anthus campestris</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Considerable numbers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span>
at Heligoland in September, much more than have been
seen for years.</p>

<p>Richard's Pipit, <i>Anthus richardi</i>, Vieill.&mdash;Up to Oct. 18th, at
Heligoland, several seen, and about half a score of young birds
shot; Oct. 24th, two; 26th, one. E., fresh, cold.</p>

<p>Great Grey Shrike, <i>Lanius excubitor</i>, Linn.&mdash;Several, Spurn,
in October; one seen by me there, Oct. 24th, and another with a
Redbreast in its beak. One occurrence, first week in same
month, on the Lincolnshire coast. Six together were noticed by
Miss M. M. Smith, near the lighthouse, at Spurn, on Feb. 17th,
probably on the spring migration to the Continent.</p>

<p>Waxwing, <i>Ampelis garrulus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Small flock on Westwood
Common, near Beverley, on Nov. 3rd. Several at Heligoland,
from Dec. 12th to end of month.</p>

<p>Flycatcher, <i>Muscicapa ?</i>&mdash;Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, April 12th, twenty-five
Flycatchers to W., wind S. Hunstanton, April 29th, seven
or eight about lanterns during night; and same station. May 6th,
several at night, wind S., stormy. At the Swin Middle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Aug. 20th to 21st, 9 a.m. to noon, several to W. At Spurn, on
Sept. 4th, two or three females, or young of <i>M. atricapilla</i>, Linn.,
Pied Flycatcher, and others up to 10th. Through August and
to Sept. 17th immense numbers of <i>M. atricapilla</i> and Redstarts
crossed Heligoland.</p>

<p>Swallow, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, Linn.&mdash;In the spring, first at
No. 5 Buoy, Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on April 23rd, going S.E. to N.W.; and
after this at several stations up to May 27th, the most southerly
the Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, forty-eight miles N.E., Cromer;
general line of flight E. to W., or S.E. to N.W. In the autumn
Swallows were observed goings south, first, at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
on July 15th; the main body passed south, as noticed at Teesmouth
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> and Whitby, in immense numbers between Aug. 28th
and Sept. 8th. Stragglers seen at Spurn up to Oct. 29th. Were
seen almost daily near Brighton during the first fortnight in
November moving eastward towards Newhaven, from near which
place, at Seaford Head, they cross to the Continent. At the
Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> (Godwin Sands), on July 29th, 5 to 7 a.m., continuous
flocks were observed to N.W., and subsequently up to Sept. 26th
at intervals, all passing westward.</p>

<p>Martin, <i>Chelidon urbica</i> (Linn.)&mdash;First, Whitby, May 10th,
passing N. On August 18th, Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, vast numbers to S. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">-23-</span>
Hampton Court Palace Gardens stragglers noticed as late as
Nov. 27th.</p>

<p>Goldfinch, <i>Carduelis elegans</i>, Steph.&mdash;On Oct. 19th, Hanois
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 10 a.m., some flocks; blue sky and cloudy. A few at Spurn,
Oct. 27th. Mouth of Deben (Suffolk), Oct. 10th, very great
numbers.</p>

<p>Siskin, <i>Chrysomitris spinus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;First at Spurn, Oct. 3rd,
subsequently during the month very numerous; flocks up to
twenty; more generally two or three together clinging to tops of
ragwort and <i>Aster Tripolium</i>; a few old males, the bulk females
and young of the year. They crossed Heligoland in considerable
numbers: first on Oct. 18th; last, Nov. 30th.</p>

<p>Greenfinch, <i>Ligurinus chloris</i> (Linn.).&mdash;On Sept. 12th, 10 a.m.,
N.N.W. (7), o.m., at Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, large flocks came in. At
Spurn, Oct. 25, 26th and 27th, small flocks, female and immature.
Heligoland, Oct. 18th, some. Immense numbers congregated in
the marsh district of North-east Lincolnshire, late in October and
early in November; females and young of the year, old males
about one in a thousand. The aggregated flocks, numbering
many thousands, frequenting the stubble fields for some weeks,
where they, found an inexhaustible supply of food in the corn
threshed out by the great gale in harvest time, on Aug. 22nd.</p>

<p>Sparrow, <i>Passer domesticus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;At the Outer Dowsing
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, fifty-three miles S.S.E. of Spurn, on April 15th, ten common
Sparrows on board, travelling from S.E. to W. In the autumn
occurred at several stations from the East Godwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on Sept.
9th and 10th, to Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Dec. 19th, none occurring at
stations north of the Outer Dowsing; line of flight E. to W., or
S.E. to N.W. Sometimes remaining all day on board the light-vessels,
or spending the night there.</p>

<p>Tree Sparrow, <i>Passer montanus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;None north of
Spurn, but south of this at several stations, as far as the
Godwin <span class="smcap">L.V.'s</span>, in October and early in November. In North-east
Lincolnshire large flocks of both species came in with the Greenfinches,
feeding with them in the same localities.</p>

<p>Chaffinch, <i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>, Linn.&mdash;First at Spurn, Oct. 9th,
females and young; last at Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 13th, 8 a.m. to noon;
continuous to W. with Linnets. None recorded north of Spurn.
Large numbers crossed Heligoland, Oct. 3 8th or 24th, with
Bramblings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span></p>

<p>Brambling, <i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spurn, Oct. 3rd,
single old males; 26th, one or two; 27th, flock of about two
hundred males: examples obtained had their stomachs filled
with the husked seed of the common charlock. Bramblings
passed Heligoland on the 24th with <i>F. c&#339;lebs</i> and <i>L. cannabina</i>.
E., very strong; and again some Nov. 30th.</p>

<p>Linnet, <i>Linota cannabina</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 13th,
8 a.m. to noon, with Chaffinches, continuous to W.</p>

<p>Mealy Redpole, <i>Linota linaria</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Spurn, considerable
flight night of Oct. 24th; subsequently observed in small flocks,
twenty to thirty, more generally three or four together, on stalks
of ragwort or <i>Aster Tripolium</i>; a few old males, very light coloured
and mealy looking, having the breast and rump washed with
crimson-rose, which colour some kept in captivity retained
throughout the winter. Out of twenty-four obtained during the
last week in October twenty-two were males, either old or young.
Examples shot, from the same flock showed great disparity both
in the length and depth of the bill, indicating probably an immigration
from widely separated districts in Scandinavia. These
Redpoles were feeding on seeds of <i>Scirpus maritimus</i> and <i>Daucus
Carota</i>, rejecting the husks. Very large numbers crossed Heligoland
in October, and again on Nov. 30th, and almost daily in
December to 20th. At the Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, on Oct. 6th, many
were noticed.</p>

<p>Lesser Redpole, <i>Linota rufescens</i> (Vieill.)&mdash;Oct. 26th, three at
Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>; and under date of Oct. 24th, Redcar, Mr. T.
H. Nelson writes, five came and alighted in front of my window,
evidently very tired; they came from seaward, 10 a.m.; two or
three were in the garden, and I saw several on the South Gore;
E.S.E., snow and rain. Oct. 25th a large flock in an adjoining
field. As the range of <i>L. rufescens</i> is confined to the British
Isles these occurrences are probably referable to a closely-allied
species, the <i>Linota exilipes</i> of Coues, the Common European
Redpole, which, so far, has not been recognised as occurring in
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Twite, <i>Linota flavirostris</i> (Linn.)&mdash;Spurn, Oct. 25th to 27th,
numerous; examples obtained had the rump rosy pink.</p>

<p>Common Bunting, <i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spurn, Oct.
25th to 27th, large arrival.</p>

<p>Yellow Bunting, <i>Emberiza citrinella</i>, Linn.&mdash;Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span>
March 8th, many, 9 a.m. Same station, Oct. 17th, great numbers
at same hour. At Teesmouth (Redcar) some on South Gare on
morning of Oct. 25th, with other immigrants.</p>

<p>Rustic Bunting, <i>E. rustica</i>, Pall.&mdash;Spurn, Sept. 17th, one,
presumed to be a female, shot on the beach near Easington by
Mr. Townend, schoolmaster. On the same date a fine young bird
was obtained on Heligoland. Light variable easterly winds over
North Sea at time.</p>

<p>Little Bunting, <i>E. pusilla</i>, Pall.&mdash;Sept. 17th, Heligoland,
seen but not obtained. Oct. 19th, one.</p>

<p>Reed Bunting, <i>E. sch&#339;niclus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Teesmouth (Redcar),
Sept. 22nd, a flock in conjunction with Chiffchaffs and Lesser
Whitethroats.</p>

<p>Lapland Bunting, <i>Plectrophanes lapponicus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;One shot
at Tetney, near Great Grimsby, Dec. 27th, by Mr. G. E. Power.</p>

<p><a id="Snow_Bunting"></a>Snow Bunting, <i>P. nivalis</i> (Linn.).&mdash;First at Spurn, Sept. 10th,
an old bird on beach; then, at Inner Farne, on Oct. 6th, four;
wind E.N.E. (3). At Heligoland, on Oct. 26th, 28th, 29th,
30th, 31st, easterly winds to N.W. and S.W.; 26th, 9 p.m. to
midnight, great many passing overhead; 28th and 29th, rain
and hail, both days very great numbers; 30th, great many; 31st,
flights of thousands high overhead&mdash;one old to about one hundred
young. Enormous and unusual flocks occurred from the Farne
Islands to N.E. Lincolnshire, from Nov. 14th to end of the year.
In the latter district, also near Redcar, many thousands together
remaining for weeks on stubble-land feeding on shaken corn. At
the South Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> the great rush was on the 23rd, 24th, and
25th Nov., and again 6th and 10th of Dec, flying S.W. At Inner
Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Dec. 4th, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., immense numbers to W.
and W.N.W.; very few old birds observed. On Nov. 8th and 9th,
at Heligoland, thousands upon thousands passed night and day
along with Shore Larks, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>. In spring of 1882,
March 28th, Spurn, a few; 29th, one on beach.</p>

<p>Sky Lark, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>, Linn.&mdash;On the night of July 25th,
1881, large numbers occurred at the Dudgeon and the Leman and
Ower <span class="smcap">L.V.'s</span>, round the lanterns, in the former case associated with
Starlings and Snipes; fifty fell on deck, and sixty at Leman and
Ower. Again, at these same light-vessels, on March 6th and
7th, great numbers occurred during night. In the autumn Sky
Larks occurred at all stations from the Inner Farne to Hanois.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span>
Earliest, Sept. 12th, Lynn Well <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>; latest, Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, July
8th, 1882. Great rush Sept. 20th, and again Oct. 17th, 18th,
19th, being then continuous all day at many stations between
Flamborough and Nore <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, less each day to 25th; frequently
associated with Starlings. At the most northerly stations the
direction of flight was south, from Spurn to the English Channel
E. to W. or S.E. to N.W. Many occurred round the lantern of
the Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on night of July 4th and 8th (seventy caught
alive on latter night); line of flight to S.W.</p>

<p>Shore Lark, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Oct. 17th to 26th,
great many almost daily, and Nov. 8th and 9th (see <a href="#Snow_Bunting">Snow Bunting</a>).
The only occurrence on the English coast is Oct. 26th,
Yarmouth, two on North Denes.</p>

<p>Starling, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring migration in 1881
observed at Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> and Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> from Feb. 25th to
April 14th. In the autumn at nearly all our mid and south-east
stations from August 30th to Dec. 11th. Heligoland, great rush
Oct. 18th and 19th. On the English coast, during last fortnight
in month, both night and day; often associated with other
migrants. Line of migration to W., S.W., N.W., W.N.W. At
Teesmouth (Redcar), on Nov. 4th, an immense flock, estimated to
contain a million, "making a noise like thunder and darkening
the air," came from E. at 7 a.m.; S.W. light, rainy to fair. Mr.
John Odgers (Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>) writes:&mdash;"We have had immense
numbers of Starlings nesting in the cliffs up to this year; none,
however, nested in 1881."</p>

<p>Daw, <i>Corvus monedula</i>, Linn.&mdash;Oct. 25th to Nov. 14th, occasionally
with rooks at east-central stations.</p>

<p>Hooded Crow, <i>Corvus cornix</i>, Linn.&mdash;In the spring of 1881, at
the Outer Dowsing on March 28th, 11 a.m., about one hundred
from W.N.W. to S.E.; and at the Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on April 8th,
7 a.m., about sixty to east. Twenty were seen at Spurn on June
26th, at 3 p.m., S.S.E., clear. In the autumn are recorded at
nearly all our stations from the Inner Farne to the Godwin's.
First at Teesmouth, Sept. 23rd, fourteen; Sept. 30th, Suffolk
coast, and for some days after. Last at South Sand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>
(Godwin), Dec. 12th. The great flight crossed Heligoland on the
17th and 18th of October, E. clear, fine but fresh. Mr. G&auml;tke
remarks this migration "differed very markedly from usual habits
in passing overhead, E. to W., at least twice as high as usual;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">-27-</span>
further, by continuing <i>passing on late in the afternoon</i>, which
accounts for your arrivals 'during night or early morn,' which,
however, I do not think has been later than soon after nightfall.
As a general rule <i>C. cornix</i>, coming here later than 2 p.m., do
not proceed on their migration, but remain on cliffs and island
all night." There was a great arrival also on the English coast
on the nights or early morning of Oct. 18th and 19th, at north,
middle and south-east stations. There was again a considerable
flight across Heligoland on Nov. 8th and 9th, and again Dec.
10th and 11th. Thirteen Carrion Crows were observed at the
Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on Oct. 26th, and a large Raven at Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
10 a.m. on Aug. 26th.</p>

<p>Rook, <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>, Linn.&mdash;In spring of 1881, at Dudgeon
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, March 7th, 10 a.m., flocks to E.S.E. At the Leman and
Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on April 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, continuous to
S.E. In the autumn, at some mid and south-east stations, first
at East Godwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 9th, all day W. to E.; last on Dec.
23rd, Lynn Wells, all day S.E. to N.W. Great rush Oct. 17th
and 18th; also 25th to 27th same month.</p>

<p>Common Swift, <i>Cypselus apus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;May 1st, Hunstanton
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, one; many on 7th. Were migrating south in large flocks
last week in August and first in September. Seen last Sept.
22nd, Spurn, 7 p.m., o.m. flocks round lantern.</p>

<p>Nightjar, <i>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spurn, May 25th,
one; are scarce in vernal migration at this station, common in
the autumn. This last year from Sept. 3rd to Oct. 3rd. The few
that turned up in Heligoland, Mr. G&auml;tke says, during all this bad
weather (Sept.), "were minus the conspicuous white patches on
primaries and remiges."</p>

<p>Green Woodpecker, <i>Gecinus viridis</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 25th, a bird, answering in every respect to this species, was
seen for some hours near the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Hoopoe, <i>Upupa epops</i>, Linn.&mdash;Near Durham, Lincolnshire
coast, and Spurn on Sept. 24th, 26th, and 29th. One, Nov. 10th,
seen perched on telegraph wire near Whittlesea Station, Great
Northern Railway.</p>

<p>Cuckoo, <i>Cuculus canorus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 29th,
noon, several seen. Many (young birds) passed Spurn last fortnight
in September.</p>

<p>Barn Owl, <i>Strix flammea</i>, Linn.&mdash;Oct. 16th, one captured at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">-28-</span>
sea on board one of the Grimsby fishing-smacks and brought in.
See Zool. 1882, p. 86.</p>

<p>Long-eared Owl, <i>Asio otus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Spurn, two, last week in
August. Redcar, one, Oct. 2nd, E.</p>

<p>Short-eared Owl, <i>Asio accipitrinus</i> (Pall).&mdash;April 12th and
15th, one each day, past Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> to W.S.W. One, Spurn,
May 25th. In the autumn, at several stations from Teesmouth
(Redcar) to Hasborough <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, from Sept. 5th to Nov. 9th, line of
flight from E. to W. or S.E. to N.W. At Redcar numerous
occurrences between Sept. 15th and Oct. 26th, with E. and N.E.
winds.</p>

<p>Snowy Owl, <i>Nyctea scandiaca</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Mr. T. H. Nelson
writes:&mdash;"A great White Owl flew up the sands in front of Redcar,
10.30 a.m., Oct. 25th, past a group of fishermen and over
the town, going S.W., wind E.N.E. strong."</p>

<p>Tengmalm's Owl, <i>Nyctala tengmalmi</i>, (Gmel.).&mdash;Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Oct. 30th, 2 a.m., one caught against lantern; Nov. 18th, one
near Dartford, Kent. ('Field,' Nov. 26th).</p>

<p>Common Buzzard, <i>Buteo vulgaris</i>, Leach.&mdash;Heligoland, Sept.
22nd, an immense flight, thousands passing on, and as many
resting on the cliffs, E. storm (No. 9); 23rd and 24th, still great
many. Numerous from Sept. 24th to Oct. 18th between the
Farne Islands and coast of Norfolk, the bulk coming in during
the last week in September. On Sept. 27th, coast of Suffolk, and
passing at a great height to the south.</p>

<p>Sparrowhawk, <i>Accipiter nisus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Heligoland, Sept. 22nd,
Sparrowhawks and Kites. At the Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Outer Dowsing,
Corton and Cockle <span class="smcap">L.V.'s</span>, the same day. A very considerable
arrival was also noted at Northrepps, near Cromer, between the
13th and 23rd of August.</p>

<p>Kite, <i>Milvus ictinus</i>, Savigny.&mdash;Yarmouth, one last week in
September.</p>

<p>Honey Buzzard, <i>Pernis apivorus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Norfolk, Oct. 6th,
nineteen Honey Buzzards, Mr. Gurney writes, up to this date.</p>

<p>Peregrine Falcon, <i>Falco peregrinus</i>, Tunstall.&mdash;Heligoland,
Sept. 22nd, Peregrines, Hobbies, and Kestrels many. Spurn,
some of each in October.</p>

<p>Common Kestrel, <i>Falco tinnunculus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Many observed

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">-29-</span></p>

<p>Osprey, <i>Pandion halia&euml;tus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;There were no less than
ten occurrences of this noble bird between the Tyne and Thames
from the last week in September through October, namely,
Durham, one; Yorkshire, one; Lincolnshire, three; Norfolk,
two; Suffolk, one; and near London, two; several others being
recorded from inland places in various parts of the kingdom. Of
the Lincolnshire examples, two were birds of the year; the other,
shot Oct. 15th near some artificial trout ponds at Laceby, near
Grimsby, was a magnificent adult female. One adult was
obtained near Chester on Nov. 17th. It is very clearly shown in
the returns that the great movement southward of the raptorial
birds began on or about Sept. 21st, and was continued during
the next fortnight.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span>
the Tees to the South Foreland <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, from the beginning of September
to the 8th of December, flying in various directions.</p>

<p>Brent Goose, <i>Bernicla brenta</i> (Pall.).&mdash;In March, 1881, many
were observed off the 5 Buoy Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> At Corton <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on June
14th, fifty from W. to N.E., "passed close to vessel; am quite
certain they were black geese." At the South Sand Head, on
Sept. 5th, 6 to 8 a.m., flocks continuous to W. At Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Oct. 15th, one Egyptian Goose, 3 p.m., to N.</p>

and 13th, great numbers E. to W. during greater part of day.
Large numbers seen at several stations off the coast in November.</p>

<p>Goosander, <i>Mergus merganser</i>, Linn.&mdash;On Oct. 22nd, Teesmouth
(Redcar), stormy E.S.E. gale, twelve were seen flying over
East Scar, nine going W. and three E.</p>

Clarke, writing from Spurn, says, "a long waved line extending
at least three or four miles passed over, extending far over the
Humber towards Lincolnshire coast, 5.15 p.m., wind changing
from N. to S., direction of flight N." At the Farne Islands,
during the month, hundreds of Golden Plovers and Lapwings
coming off to the islands in morning, and leaving for the land at

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span>
Spurn, on June 13th, 4 p.m., N.E., clear, Grey Plovers were seen
passing S. to N. In the autumn, in the first week in August,
three old birds in breeding plumage on Humber muds; also
several old black-breasted birds seen at Spurn on 24th. The

(M&eacute;n&eacute;tri&eacute;s), on Humber muds.</p>

<p>Dotterel, <i>Eudromias morinellus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;May 14th to 21st,
some "trips" in N.E. Lincolnshire marshes, also at localities in
Holderness; twenty seen in one flock, thirty in another.</p>

<p>Lapwing, <i>Vanellus vulgaris</i>, Bechst.&mdash;At the north-eastern
stations, noticeably at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Inner
Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, and Lynn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, where very large numbers
passed from Oct. 6th to Nov. 12th, general direction S.E. to
N.W. At Teesmouth (Redcar), Nov. 4th, an immense immigration
between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., passing westward, flocks
numbering from 50 up to 500 birds, a flock coming in from seaward
every ten minutes or thereabouts; S.W., light, fine, and
mild.</p>

<p>Turnstone, <i>Strepsilas interpres</i> (Linn.).&mdash;May 25th, many
both mature and immature on coasts of N.E. Lincolnshire and
Holderness. Teesmouth, in the autumn, not so plentiful as
usual; common in other localities.</p>

<p>Oystercatcher, <i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>, Linn.&mdash;At Teesmouth
(Redcar), Aug. 18th, 6 a.m., three or four hundred, N.N.E.,
light, dull and showery. Hunstanton <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, flocks S.W. at ebb,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span></p>

<p>Grey Phalarope, <i>Phalaropus fulicarias</i>, Linn.&mdash;Teesmouth
(Redcar), Oct. 15th, two, in adult plumage, only a few grey
feathers on back, N.N.W. gale; one seen near Redcar same day.</p>

<p>Woodcock, <i>Scolopax rusticula</i>, Linn.&mdash;May 24th, Outer Dowsing
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, one, 10.30 a.m., E.S.E. (4), passing from W. by N. to E.S.E.
At numerous stations in the autumn [principally in the north
and mid-east], from Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> to East Godwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> First
at Spurn, on Sept. 4th; last at Heligoland, Nov. 30th, "a few
Woodcocks and Snipe" (first and only occurrence there in 1881).
Greatest flight on English coast night of Oct. 28th, N.E., snow
and sleet. Woodcocks have dropped in very irregularly throughout
the autumn, by two's and three's during October, and not in
those great rushes which usually characterise their immigration.
Migrate generally during the night; frequent exceptions to this
rule. Casualties against the lanterns of lighthouses and light-vessels
from midnight till daybreak.</p>

<p>Double Snipe, <i>Gallinago major</i> (Gmel.).&mdash;One, Sept. 15th,
was shot in a clover field about fifteen miles from Redcar. One,
Sept. 4th, at Spurn, killed against the telegraph-wire; another,
same locality, 16th; one, Seaton Carew, Durham, 27th same
month.</p>

<p>Common Snipe, <i>Gallinago c&aelig;lestis</i> (Frenzel).&mdash;Some few last
week in July, main body last week of October to first week in
November, rapidly passing on. Nov. 23rd, Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 10.30 a.m.,
about 100 to. W. Spring migration, 1882, second week in
March.</p>

<p>Jack Snipe, <i>Gallinago gallinula</i> (Linn.).&mdash;The only occurrences
recorded at Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, from Sept. 23rd to Nov. 4th.
Mouth of Deben, Suffolk, both this and the former are recorded
from Sept. 30th to Oct. 1st, at full moon, with E. wind, in large
quantities, continuing to arrive for some time; remarkable by its
entire absence from its ordinary winter quarters.</p>

<p>Dunlin, <i>Tringa alpina</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spurn, May 25th, very large
flocks, composed of birds some in summer plumage, others having
no appearance of changing from ordinary winter garb. Enormous
flocks were seen at some north-eastern stations in October.
Great number at Teesmouth (Redcar), from Sept. 15th to Oct.
12th, all going W.N.W., towards the Tees.</p>

<p>Little Stint, <i>Tringa minuta</i>, Leisl.&mdash;In small flocks on
Humber foreshores, from Sept. 2nd to as late as Oct. 8th.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">-34-</span>
Fresh arrivals easily recognisable by their extreme tameness.
Comparatively plentiful on coasts of Holderness, Lincolnshire,
and Norfolk during the same period.</p>

<p>Temminck's Stint, <i>Tringa Temmincki</i>, Leisl.&mdash;One early in
September, near Yarmouth; a few regularly occur at this season
on the east coast, although rarely obtained, and probably also
frequently overlooked.</p>

<p>Pigmy Curlew, <i>Tringa subarquata</i> (G&uuml;ld.).&mdash;First at Spurn,
July 21st, two in summer plumage. Flocks of young, thirty to
fifty, numerous through September and October in the same
districts as the Little Stint.</p>

<p>Knot, <i>Tringa canutus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spurn, June 7th, 6 p.m., "Plover-Knot"
from N. to S. Some, birds of the previous year, and
which do not acquire the summer dress, remain on the east
coast during the summer. The first arrivals of young Knot
occurred during the first week in August; great rush (young
birds) first week in September, the old coming during the
last week, in October. Mr. Winson, the captain of the Spurn
life-boat, picked up a Knot on Nov. 7th, which was killed
by flying against the telegraph-wire; this bird was in faded
summer plumage, the upper parts nearly black, with edgings of
buff on the margins of the feathers.</p>

<p>Ruff and Reeve, <i>Machetes pugnax</i> (Linn.).&mdash;On Sept. 3rd, two
shot from a flock of nine on Cowpen Marsh, near Redcar, N.E.,
stormy. One Ruff and two Reeves were also obtained at Spurn
early in September.</p>

<p>Sanderling, <i>Calidris arenaria</i> (Linn.).&mdash;May 25th, some at
Spurn, young of previous year, and in immature plumage. Aug.
1st, flock of nine; and henceforward in large numbers during
August and September, many remaining on the coast till end of
the year, and into 1882. At Teesmouth (Redcar) they are
reported scarcer this season than they have been for many
years.</p>

<p>Common Sandpiper, <i>Totanus hypoleucus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;May 14th
to 20th, North-east Lincolnshire, flocks passing along the coast
northward, returning first week in September.</p>

<p>Green Sandpiper, <i>Totanus ochropus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;July 30th,
returning.</p>

<p>Wood Sandpiper, <i>Totanus glareola</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Aug. 6th, one
shot near Redcar; small flock seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">-35-</span></p>

<p>Common Redshank, <i>Totanus calidris</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Scarce near
Teesmouth in the autumn. At Spurn, July 31st, many.</p>

<p>Spotted Redshank, <i>Totanus fuscus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Teesmouth,
about Sept. 15th; one, a fully-matured bird, obtained.</p>

<p>Greenshank, <i>Totanus canescens</i> (Gmel.).&mdash;Comparatively
numerous in Humber district in September and October, more
than have been seen for many years.</p>

<p>Bar-tailed Godwit, <i>Limosa lapponica</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Passed the
Tees in considerable numbers first week in September. Very
common in Humber district in September and October. At
Redcar (Teesmouth), between July 4th and 7th, about thirty
passed each morning to W. On Sept. 22nd, a slight "rush";
several large flocks with Knots, both in morning and afternoon,
going W.; E. gale, stormy, with heavy rain.</p>

<p>Whimbrel, <i>Numenius ph&aelig;opus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;At Spurn, May 25th,
three seen. Teesmouth (Redcar), July 4th to 7th, each day a few
seen in morning, S.W., fine. Aug. 17th, continuous flocks with
Curlews and Godwits from 6 to 9 a.m., and also the preceding
night, W., calm; and at intervals to Sept. 23rd, all flying W. or
N.W. Last occurrence Oct. 22nd. 5 Buoy Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, at 11 a.m.,
twenty to S.W.</p>

<p>Curlew, <i>Numenius arquata</i> (Linn.).&mdash;On May 1st and 18th, at
Inner Farne and Flamborough, round lanterns during night.
At various localities in the autumn, from July 17th to end of
September. Great rush, with Whimbrels and Godwits, on Aug.
17th.</p>

<p>Terns, <span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;</span>.&mdash;At the Farne Islands, in 1881, the Sandwich
Terns returned on May 6th, the Arctic Terns on the 9th;
they left again in a body, both old and young, on Aug. 21st.
From Sept. 2nd to 5th, hundreds of both species revisited and
settled upon their breeding grounds. After this, from Sept. 16th
to the end of the month, two to three hundred Arctic Terns, both
old and young, were observed daily fishing near island (Inner
Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>), leaving again at night. Three Arctic Terns, two
old and one young, were seen fishing off island on Oct. 27th,
and on 29th a single young bird. A flock of about thirty Common
Terns were to be seen in front of Redcar daily up to Oct.
14th, when the great storm evidently drove them south. Both
at Redcar and Flamborough, throughout September, great
numbers of Terns were noticed passing south. At Spurn, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">-36-</span>
May, 1881, small parties of Black Terns were passing north, a
few returning southward by the same route in August. The
Lesser Terns returned to their nesting quarters at Spurn in the
third week in May. At Coquet Island <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, on the night of Aug.
22nd, fog. Terns with Curlews were all night beating about the
lantern. In 1882, March 29th, Spurn, two Terns [sp. ?] seen
passing north.</p>

<p>Gulls, <span class="smcap">Larin&aelig;</span>.&mdash;The Herring Gulls returned to their breeding
stations at Whitby on Feb. 14th; they left the cliffs with their
young on Aug. 26th. Lesser Black-backed Gulls were observed
congregating at their nesting quarters, on the Farne Islands, on
April 13th. At Flamborough, on July 4th, great numbers of
Kittiwakes were passing to the south all day. Unusual numbers
of Herring Gulls and Little Gulls (<i>L. minutus</i>, Pall.) were seen
off Flamborough in September. At Spurn, on Oct. 26th, two
Little Gulls were seen; and about the 22nd two immature
Sabine's Gull, <i>Xema Sabinii</i>, procured on the Norfolk coast,
some Little Gulls being seen at the same time. At Teesmouth
(Redcar), on Sept. 22nd, continuous flocks of Herring and Lesser
Black-backed Gulls, young birds, passed from daylight to dusk,
all going N.W., strong E. gale, rain. On Oct. 23rd, and for
several days previous. Great Black-backed Gulls had been
passing to N.W., forty to one hundred in the course of a day,
E.S.E. winds, all mature birds. It is many years since so large
a number of Great Black-backs had been seen passing. At the
Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on Nov. 11th, continuous flocks of Gulls were passing
westward all day; and on Dec. 29th, at Lynn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, flocks
all day from E. to W.</p>

<p>Skuas, <span class="smcap">Stercorariin&aelig;</span>.&mdash;On July 12th, a flock of one hundred
(probably <i>S. crepidatus</i>) passed at 8.30 p.m. to N.W., high over
Redcar, wind W. On Sept. 16th a great many Skuas were seen
on the fishing grounds, five to six miles out, Richardson's,
Pomatorhine, and Buffon's busily engaged chasing the Gulls and
Terns; and again on Sept. 29th, a great many Richardson's,
Pomatorhine, and a few Buffon's Skuas seen from four to twelve
miles at sea by fishermen similarly employed. On Oct. 14th,
during the gale from N.N.W., great numbers of Pomatorhine
came down from north, passing Redcar and going off inland,
mostly flying high. The same day a large mixed flock of
Pomatorhine and Buffon's Skua was seen near the Breakwater,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">-37-</span>
crouching on the ground to get shelter from the tempest of wind
and rain. Great numbers of Skuas passed Flamborough in
September; on Oct. 4th, four Richardson's Skuas were seen off
Yarmouth; and on Nov. 23rd, at Southsand Head <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, great
numbers ("Bonxie's and chasers") with Gannets.</p>

<p>Petrels, <span class="smcap">Procellariid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;During the gale on Oct. 14th, several
Storm Petrels seen coming past Redcar from the north; they
also occurred from Aug. 10th to Nov. 20th at several stations,
not unfrequently striking the lanterns of lighthouses and light-vessels
on clear as well as on foggy nights. The Fork-tailed
Petrel (<i>P. leucorrhoa</i>) occurred at various stations, both on the
coast and inland, between Oct. 24th and Nov. 28th, one at
Heligoland, in December, being only the second obtained during
Mr. G&auml;tke's long residence in the island. It is probable that
this, being a west coast species, is driven in the autumn by heavy
gales right across the island on to our east coast&mdash;that is, from
N.W. to S.E.; its rarity at Heligoland in the autumn supports
this view of the line taken by stragglers occurring inland,
and on our east coast after heavy N. and S.W. gales. <i>Puffinus
anglorum</i> and <i>P. major</i> passed Flamborough, in September, in
considerable numbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Flamborough, on April 28th, great numbers of
Guillemots arrived during the day; and on the 29th the Puffins
returned for the season. At the Farne Islands a white Guillemot
was seen in June and July. The Guillemots and Puffins left
their breeding stations between Aug. 20th and 28th. At Whitby,
on Aug. 17th and 21st, very large flocks of Guillemots were seen
passing north.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colymbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;From Aug. 13th to Nov. 8th, at intervals, many
Great Northern and Red-throated Divers seen off Redcar. At

<p><span class="smcap">Podicipitid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At the Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, in February, 1881,
an unusual number of Grebes and small Divers were observed.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>The results of the observations taken along the East Coast of
England in the spring and autumn of 1881 have been satisfactory;
it is true that, as already mentioned, the returns sent in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">-38-</span>
have been less than in the previous year, yet what has been lost
in quantity has more than been made up in the quality of the
work. The observers have become trained by experience, and
have learnt not only how to observe, but what to observe.</p>

<p>As in previous years, the main line of migration has been a
broad stream from E. to W. or from S.E. to N.W. this year,
covering the whole of our east coast in comparatively equal
proportions; the occurrences of migrants coming from northerly
directions, or from points anything north of east, are few and
far between, and in these cases are consequent on birds striking
the coast in more northern latitudes and following it to the
south. Thus, north of Flamborough, Larks pass up the coast
from north to south; at Spurn and south of Spurn they come in
directly from the sea. The closeness with which both migrants
and immigrants follow the coast line has also been verified in a
remarkable degree,&mdash;an observer taking up his position at a short
distance from the coast would see or know nothing of migration,
yet within half-a-mile or less there might be a constant stream
of birds, hour by hour and day by day passing to the south.</p>

<p>In the spring birds also return on the same lines they travelled
in the autumn, from W. and N.W. to E. and S.E. A reference
to the spring notes in the report on each separate species observed
will show this. Our spring immigrants also arrive from the sea,
and are first seen on or near the coast, gradually moving inland.
Migration has been earlier than in 1880, in many cases birds
arriving considerably in advance of recent years; this has been
notably the case with some of the <i>Limicol&aelig;</i>, such as have the
widest ranges and where nesting grounds are circumpolar&mdash;that
is, confined to lands surrounding the North Pole. Also in the
case of the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>, which arrived fully a month before their
average period.</p>

<p>It may be said the general features of migration, having
reference to lines of flight, time, height of travelling, favourable
winds or otherwise, circumstances of greatest casualties at lanterns
of lighthouses and light-vessels, are the same as set forth in
previous reports; yet in 1881 we find several important variations
from the normal phenomenon, consequent on the directions of the
wind and general character of the season. From the commencement
of August to the end of October the prevailing winds have
been from northerly and easterly directions, blowing more or less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">-39-</span>
directly on to the coast, and therefore, as also shown in previous
reports, unfavourable passage winds&mdash;for it may be laid down as
an axiom that, with southerly or westerly winds, not amounting
to gales, normal migration is the rule, but with winds in the
opposite direction, the results are very opposite; such winds,
more especially if strong, weary out the immigrants and compel
them to drop on the first coast they make, often completely
exhausted by the passage. The consequence has been that, on
our east coast, with the prevailing winds, it has been a most
favourable season for the observer; and generally the number of
birds recorded is considerably in excess of any previous records.</p>

<p>The winter of 1881-82 has been remarkable for its high
temperature, no such uniformly mild season having occurred for
many years in England. The same has been the case over the
whole of Northern Europe north of latitude 50&deg; N. As might be
expected, so exceptional a season has not been without its effect
upon our immigrants. Fieldfares have crossed in very limited
numbers, and have everywhere been remarkably scarce in
localities along our east coast. Large numbers of birds which
regularly arrive in the autumn, as the Greenfinch, Chaffinch,
Tree Sparrow, Snow Bunting, and others, and which remain for
a few days only and then pass on, have this winter continued for
many weeks, and even months, resorting in immense flocks to
the stubble-fields near the coast, where, with no severe weather
to drive them away, they found an inexhaustible supply of food
in the large quantity of grain dashed out in harvest-time by the
great gale from S.W. to W. on August 26th. Snow Buntings
have been considerably in excess of anything known for many
years, the proportion of old birds not more than one in a
hundred.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the mildness of the winter is the
desultory fashion in which birds have migrated; there have been
less of those great "rushes," when for days together one species
after another rush helter-skelter on to our coast. Migration has also
been greatly prolonged, and the latest returns received show Rooks,
Starlings, and Larks still crossing the North Sea in February.
The last week in August and first in September Wheatears and
Redstarts passed as usual up the coast from N. to S., the line of
migration being confined to the chain of sandhills. Also during
the first week of September, and again about the 20th, there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span>
an immense migration of the <i>Sylviin&aelig;</i> in the same direction.
Migration appears to have reached its climax on or about
Sept. 22nd, an enormous number of various immigrants coming
in from this time to the end of the month. Not the least
remarkable was the influx of the larger raptorial birds crossing
Heligoland on Sept. 22nd and two following days, and were
about the same period seen along the entire range of our eastern
coast. From this date to the end of October ten Ospreys were
procured from localities contiguous to the east coast of England,
between the Tyne and the Thames. Again, the third week of
October there was another large immigration of birds of various
species. On the night of Oct. 24th great numbers of Mealy
Redpoles came in on the Holderness coast; the same flight was
also traceable as far north as the Farne Islands; the Mealy
Redpoles appear to have been accompanied or closely followed
by a flight of Siskins. Hooded Crows came with their usual
regularity, almost to a day; this autumn the great flight crossed
Heligoland on the afternoon of Oct. 17th, and on the 18th.
There was a corresponding arrival along the whole of our east
coast on the night of 17th or early morning of 18th, and on
the 19th.</p>

<p>Short-eared Owls, Golden Crested Wrens, and Woodcocks
arrive with great punctuality during the first fortnight in October,
and are invariably associated in their migration&mdash;that is, coming
at the same time; it is a curious fact that, in the last autumn,
all three arrived in conjunction five weeks in advance of their
average period; this perhaps may have been a local and coast
movement from North Britain, and not across the North Sea.</p>

<p>In August and early in September, Knots, Grey Plovers,
Sanderlings, Curlew Sandpipers, and Little Stints&mdash;all circumpolar
in their nesting&mdash;had returned in large number, being
unusually abundant and early in their movements up the
coast.</p>

<p>The <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> have been remarkably scarce in shore and
within our river estuaries, and it has been an almost blank
season for the wildfowl-shooter; yet we find, in the returns from
some light-vessels, they have occurred in extraordinary numbers
out at sea, the weather having never been sufficiently severe to
drive them inland or near the coast.</p>

<p>With a dry hot summer in Northern Europe migration is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span>
always earlier than in years of rain and low temperature, birds
breeding sooner in the former, and the nestlings, like all other
young things, with dry weather and sunshine, developing more
rapidly.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable in the phenomenon of migration
than the punctuality with which certain species return in the
autumn, one species regularly taking precedence of another;
also in respect to the date of the arrival year after year. In the
<i>Limicol&aelig;</i> and <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> the date of autumn migration varies&mdash;often
considerably&mdash;from year to year. In some species, as the
Wheatear, Redstart, Fieldfare, Redwing, Hooded Crow, Goldcrest
and Woodcock, and others, we may almost predict to a day the
time of their first appearance.</p>

<p>The period of the migratory flight in the autumn of any
particular genus or species is most probably referable to two
causes: the first one of temperature, affecting the time of
nesting; the second is the period at which the young arrive at
maturity, or rather that period when they throw off paternal
control or are thrown off themselves. When able to act independently
and procure food on their own account, they flock
together and migrate in a body. We know that, with rare
exceptions, the young of the year migrate some weeks in advance
of the parent birds; thus we can readily conceive the whole of
the large raptorial birds nesting about the same time over
widely extending districts in Northern Europe; when the many
young arrive at a self-dependent stage there would be a
simultaneous movement, ending in a universal migratory rush.
This period of self-dependence is arrived at much more quickly
in some birds than in others, for species like the Knot, Grey
Plover, Godwit, and Sanderling, nesting in very high latitudes,
leave our shores the last in the spring of any of the migrants,
and their young are amongst the first to return in autumn.
The order of migration, more especially in connection with the
shore birds, is the occurrence very early in autumn&mdash;July or
August&mdash;of a few <i>old</i> birds in summer plumage, either barren or
such perhaps as have been prevented nesting, then the young in
large flocks, and some weeks subsequently old birds.</p>

<p>The season of 1881-82 will long be remembered by east
coast ornithologists for the number of rare visitants which have
appeared from time to time, driven to westward of their ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">-42-</span>
migration lines by the prevailing winds from N. and N.E. to
E. and S.E., generally strong and frequently increasing to a
severe gale. The fact of ten Ospreys having been seen or
procured has already been mentioned; there were two occurrences
of Tengmalm's Owl; the Rustic Bunting at Spurn; Lapp
Bunting at Tetney, on Lincolnshire coast; White-spotted Blue-throat
at Cley, in Norfolk; Glossy Ibis, five occurrences;
Sabine's Gull, two on Norfolk coast; Kentish Plover, Lincolnshire;
Blue-winged Teal, Teesmouth; and numerous other
occurrences of scarcely secondary interest. These, as well as
the rarer occurrences in Heligoland, have been separately treated
in the notes on each species observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schedules</span>, &amp;c., were sent to thirty-eight stations, the same
number as in 1880. We have received filled-in schedules from
twenty-six stations, being same as last year.</p>

<p>Generally the returns are light, and the scarcity of birds is
accounted for by the reporters, and borne out by comparison of
statistics, by the prevalence of westerly gales and winds (see
General Remarks). The schedules show the same careful work
as in former years.</p>

<p>The dates upon which the various stations have sent us
returns are shown in the following list of the stations by the
positions of the asterisks preceding the consecutive numbers.
Stations added have the dates preceding the names. As will be
seen, the work done will compare favourably with the East Coast
returns, and also with that of previous seasons.</p>

small extent in a rush of migrants generally Sept. 21st to 23rd,
which appeared on both coasts of Scotland. Indications of a
small rush Oct. 25th to 27th also. Other records scattered
through September, October, November, and December. Blackbird.
No spring records. Autumn: At Monach, Sound of
Mull, Lismore, Skervuile, Turnberry, Mull of Galloway, Little
Ross, Douglas Head. Earliest Sept. 21st, at Mull of Galloway
(date of rush also on East Coast q.v.); latest Dec. 20th,
at Turnberry (one struck). Rushes: None very apparent,
but, taking dates of other species, appear to have mingled
with them on September 21st to 23rd at Sound of Mull and Mull
of Galloway (which is also date of general rush on the east
coast). Also faint indications of rushes at Lismore on Oct. 5th,
mingled with Thrushes; and on Dec. 13th to 19th at several
stations, as Lismore, Skervuile, and Turnberry. A good many
scattered records also at other dates and several stations.
Exceptionally numerous were Song Thrushes and Missel Thrushes
near Dumfries in October and November, whilst Redwings and
Fieldfares were very seldom seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wheatear. Spring records only from Butt
of Lewis, Rhuvaal, and Skerryvore; March 9th (a flock), April
1st (at Rhuvaal), and May 6th (at Skerryvore). Autumn: At
Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Lamlash, Turnberry, Corsewall.
Earliest Aug. 14th at Skerryvore (two seen); latest Oct. 27th,
when one seen along with Sparrows and Wrens in garden.
Rushes on Aug. 7th at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach (150 at
former and numbers at latter). Another appears also at Skerryvore
on Sept. 7th during the night. Desultory migration going
on between these dates and till Oct. 27th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Robin. Only one spring record, April 9th, at
Skerryvore. Autumn: At Rhu Stoir,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Kyleakin, Isle Ornsay,
Lismore, Skervuile, Lamlash, Corsewall, Portpatrick, Little Ross.
Earliest Aug. 17th, at Skervuile; next earliest Aug. 21st, when
a pair, male and female, arrived at Little Ross; latest on Dec.
18th, at Kyleakin. Participated slightly in rush of migrants on
Sept. 22nd. No other distinctly perceptible, but scattered occurrences
only recorded. One accompanied Hedgesparrows and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span>
Wrens. One Chat and one Wagtail in Garden of Lamlash on
Oct. 27th. Mr. Service notes the "quick and simultaneous
departure of the <i>Silviid&aelig;</i>" towards the end of September in
the S.W. of Scotland. It is curious to find that about
the same time that birds were pouring into Scotland and
England others were starting on their departure. In ordinary
seasons the departure of the <i>Sylviin&aelig;</i> is gradual all through
September.</p>

14th or 15th. Desultory at other dates between times. Mostly
observed at lanterns in easterly breezes. Exception at Mull of
Galloway on September 21st in S.W. wind, but after twenty-four
hours E.S.E. (see Isle of May, East Coast of Scotland).</p>

reported as seen on migration. Earliest Sept. 5th, when a
hundred were seen at Point of Ayre; latest Oct. 27th, when a
number were seen at Lamlash. A still later date is Jan. 1st,
1882, when one was seen at Rhuvaal. Rushes appear to have
occurred at Point of Ayre on Sept. 5th and 22nd, and a few
on Oct. 7th mingled with Linnets, and at Lamlash on Oct. 27th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;"Titmice." One record in spring at Mull of Galloway
on April 14th in E.S.E. wind. Autumn: Twice recorded only

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">-47-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wagtail. In spring, several in March, and two

all during May, and to June 15th often mixed with Martins.
Autumn: At Skervuile, Lamlash, Turnberry, Loch Ryan, Mull

Bushes on Sept. 14th at Little Ross, and a smaller number on

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">-48-</span>
always real Grey Linnets, or Twites, or Mountain Linnets, our
reporters not distinguishing them. House Sparrows. About
two hundred, "supposed to be of this species," rested all night
at Point of Ayr on Sept. 16th. Bramblings are reported in

and "flocks" in September, flying south at Lismore, Skervuile,

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>In 1879 there was scarcity of birds at many important
stations, such as Butt of Lewis and Monach Island, Skerryvore and
Dhuheartach. In that year westerly and N.W. winds prevailed.
In 1880 larger numbers were noted. In that year easterly
gales and winds prevailed all through the migratory season. In
1879 migrants were scarce at the more northerly stations, being
compressed by the westerly winds more towards the south, but
in 1880 they reached much further north, being expanded by the
following easterly gales and winds, as we have seen in treating
of the east coast of Scotland this year.</p>

<p>The stations visited by the largest numbers of birds are the Bell
Rock and Isle of May, both being stations pretty far southward,
and Pentland Skerries, a more northern station. We now find
also that on the west coast the stations sending fullest numerical
returns are also southerly stations, and for the most part are
situated south of the Firth of Clyde. Both on east and west
coasts all returns coming in from north of Firth of Clyde in
west, and north of Firth of Tay in east, except Pentland Skerries,
report scarcity of birds as compared with last season (1880), and
after November birds were unusually scarce. Writing from
North Ronaldshay Mr. Tulloch tells us that birds seldom come
so far north during migration, but usually trend more towards
the mainland. On the west coast, at Rhu Stoir, very few birds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">-54-</span>
are reported after November in most seasons, and similar reports
come from Island Glass and others of the more northerly stations.
The great gales from W. and S.W. during November and December
made all birds scarce at Monach Island, even Eider Ducks
being unusually scarce. At Skerryvore birds never struck
lanterns in flocks this year, but only in scattered instances. It
will thus be seen that the migratory seasons of 1879 and 1881
most closely resemble each other, as regards our Scottish coasts,
whilst that of 1880 was more abnormal, owing to the easterly
winds prevailing.</p>

<p>It would almost appear that the great rush of migrants in
September on the Bell Rock, and more noticeably on Isle of May,
would also account for the collection of birds at stations on the
west coast south of the Firth of Clyde, as the dates tally with
each other on both coasts, to see which it is only necessary to
compare between them under several of the species. I have also
independent reports upon the large crowds of birds seen passing
south over the Solway Firth at these dates, few of which appear
to have been seen north of the Firth of Clyde.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Rushes have
not been so large, yet they are indicated with tolerable precision
by the returns. The extremely regular and open winter has no
doubt much to do with this, the temperature in Great Britain
having been higher than for many years previous. But these throbs
or rushes being distinctly traceable is owing, on the other hand, I
believe, to the prevailing wind fully as much as to the severity or
non-severity of the weather. Rushes are normal phenomena in
the West of Europe, because westerly or north-westerly or southwesterly
winds usually prevail there. Regular or more dispersed
movements of birds in the West of Europe are abnormal, because
easterly winds are abnormal there. In 1880 we had a <i>spread-fan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">-55-</span></i>
of migration, if I may so express it. In 1879 and 1881, in
Scotland, we had a <i>closed-fan</i> of migration. The natural result
of the wide-spread fan is continuous streams of migration and
no rushes; that of the closed-fan great throbs and rushes, for
birds prefer to travel with a beam wind and wait for favourable
winds, and do not often voluntarily start on their flight with a
following wind. The occurrence of the white-spotted form of
Blue-throated Warbler after a succession of tremendous S.E.
gales, culminating in the dreadful hurricane of Oct. 14th, clearly
shows, I think, that acts of voluntary migration do not take place
in following winds. This Bluethroat was caught up and borne
away, <i>nolens volens</i>, and our Mid-Atlantic notes in 1880 show
similar abnormal results from prevalence of easterly gales. It
is to be regretted that we have no returns this season from Mid-Atlantic,
owing to Mr. Anderson's engagements in the Mediterranean.
Even total absence or perfectly negative evidence of
birds in Mid-Atlantic would have given us a valuable standpoint
as compared with the great mortality of 1880.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Mr. R. Service contributes the following:&mdash;"The severe gales retarded
the migration of the shore birds during October to a great extent, causing
them to "accumulate" in our district for several weeks. On October 12th I
saw a twenty-acre field completely covered with Lapwings. At the same
time, and for about a fortnight afterwards, the number of birds on the Solway
banks was most extraordinary. The great majority of these were Bar-tailed
Godwits, Oystercatchers, and Knots. Just outside the line of breakers
opposite the rocks at Southerness Point, Scaups and Scoters were especially
numerous, diving above the mussel beds. As they rose and fell on the
crests of the heaving waves these birds formed many an interesting and
beautiful group."</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> I may mention here that I have made an endeavour to enlist the
whaling captains of Dundee in our service, but have not yet learned whether
it has been successful or not. I had copies of the British Association
Abstract reprinted in a cheap form, and I sent a bundle to Dundee for
distribution amongst the captains. Should Mr. Anderson yet give us any
Mediterranean statistics, they can appear as an Appendix to our Report
for 1882.</p>

</div>

<p>The lines of migration indicated in my Report of Scotland
for 1879 and 1880, and conclusions drawn from statistics of these
two years, appear to me to be borne out by those of 1881, as
regards the semicircular form of the migration, an account
of which I have already given in our last report (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 18, 19).</p>

<p>The subject of heights of lanterns and their colours as
attractions for birds has not developed as yet any fresh facts, but,
with the conviction that they will yet do so, I still retain the
table of heights given. Actual experiment, however, would very
likely very soon set this part of the subject at rest (vide General
Remarks, East Coast of Scotland Report, 1880, pp. 19, 20). A
light-vessel or two placed in an equally favourable position with,
let us say, the Isle of May or the Bell Rock on the east coast, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">-56-</span>
at some point north of Tweed, would, I believe, soon show us
whether the preponderance of records south of the Tweed is
entirely due to old-established lines of migration, or to the
number of light-vessels on the English coast, or partly to both.
It would, I think, assist in proving or disproving theories of land-communications
which have been advanced and disputed by
previous writers. At present we cannot positively state from
our present data whether an actual or only an apparent preponderance
of birds pass south of the Tweed in autumn. It
appears a little curious to find, however, a highway of migration
by the Pentland Firth so much further north than the stations
mentioned. Writing from North Ronaldshay Mr. Tulloch
remarks upon the usual scarcity of birds there, and says
"they keep more direct for the mainland"; and he remarks
also upon the abundance of birds seen in September
and November at Pentland Skerries, where he was lighthouse-keeper
for four years. He remarks on the abundance of Mountain
Thrushes, Blackbirds, Owls, Woodcocks, Wrens, Robins, and
Titmice which occur there when the wind is from the east, and
from which station I have a large numerical return this year.
This at first sight appears to be a contradiction of what I have
said about the bulk of the birds passing south of Bell Rock, but, be
it noted, the prevailing winds at Pentland Skerries from August
23rd to September 12th were from points between north and
south by east, but never by west, and thereafter, between
September 14th and October 10th, they were prevailing south to
south-west, but never west or north-west. From October 14th
they backed to north-east, and easterly winds again prevailed
here on till late in November. The isolated position of the
lights at Pentland Skerries, combined with the local prevalence
of easterly winds, is perhaps sufficient to account for the large
mass of the records. At all events I think the Pentland Skerries
returns are deserving, both now and in future, of special attention
and study, and I look upon it as a particularly interesting
station.</p>

<p>Isle of May stands this year at the head of the list for numerical
returns, I having received seven full schedules from Mr.
Agnew, principally referring to autumn migration. Next comes
Bell Rock, but two out of three schedules refer to spring
migration, of which more anon. Then Sumburgh Head and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">-57-</span>
Pentland Skerries, about equal, but the latter rather the
larger, both returning three filled schedules, principally autumn
migration.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Besides several more relating to 1882.</p>

</div>

<p>Regarding the spring migration, the Bell Rock and the Isle
of May have hitherto held their place as yielding the largest
returns, and very considerable numerical returns are given for
1881. Now, Sandwich Terns pass every spring up north along
the coast of Forfarshire, but shoot off from the land again, and
do not breed upon much of the suitable lands they pass over.
An occasional pair of birds do remain and breed, as is shown
by the nesting of this species on Inch Mickery, in the Firth
of Forth, this past season, and on a previous occasion at the
same place. In the same way we know that Grey Plover,
Knot, and Bar-tailed Godwit shoot off the land at Spurn Point,
as they are obtained there in full breeding dress, but nowhere
to the north of it in breeding plumage, except in isolated
cases. The routes of spring migrants, while they are usually
more direct than those of autumn migrants, are perhaps more
difficult to trace, and our statistics as yet are far from perfect.
Since the above remarks were penned I have a well-filled schedule
from Isle of May relating to the spring migration of 1882, which,
however, will be included in our next Report.</p>

<p>The extraordinarily large migration of raptorial birds is worth
a remark here, and it is interesting to find with what regularity
and precision such foreign species as the Rough-legged Buzzard
recur year after year along certain very clearly defined lines,
records of captures constantly indicating this.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the results of our statistics on the Scottish
coasts show a "closed-fan" of migration, owing to prevalence of
westerly winds, except at Pentland Skerries, where local easterly
winds blew at the times of migration in September and November,
and on the Scottish coast, from Bell Rock and southward,
we had the greatest rushes, whilst further south, on the English
coasts, there was an "open-fan" of migration, owing to a prevalence
of east winds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schedules</span>, &amp;c., were forwarded to forty lighthouses and
light-vessels on the west coast of England; from twenty-four
returns have been received. The absence of returns is in some
cases due to accident, <i>e. g.</i>, at Caernarvon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Mr. Bowen, the
keeper, had been disabled with a broken rib, the result of a fall on
board in a gale of wind, and there had been several changes of
mates within a short period. In part, absence of reports is
accounted for by the situation of the station&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, at Nash are
two lighthouses, and from the western one, Mr. Richards, who
last year supplied us with a well-filled schedule, having retired
from the service, his successor objected to continue the work on
the ground that it is so near to Nash E. On Lundy Island also
are two stations close to each other, and last year the two
reports therefrom were almost identical in every particular
instance. Menai is reported as being out of the track of birds
migrating, as also St. Bees. Still we should be glad to hear
from these and the other stations that have not reported, and
hope that next year all will send in returns, however slight, as
"every little helps." Special thanks are due to those who have
reported; they have given themselves considerable trouble, which
will, however, not be thrown away; and the novelty and interesting
nature of the work may in some degree perhaps compensate
them for their pains. Mr. Baker writes, from Milford,
"It would be a great help if a book could be supplied to different
reporters, with a print of the different birds in it." If funds can
be raised, we hope in time to &amp; able to supply this want.</p>

<p>To Mr. Thompson we are indebted for a report from a new
station, Allonby, on Solway Firth, which promises to be a good
one, and which&mdash;being the northernmost on this coast&mdash;now heads
our list.</p>

<p>The numbers of the stations differ from those of last year's
report, beginning at 121 instead of 110 (the last included in
Report of West Coast of Scotland being 120). The following is

"two or three Robins and Sparrows" were noticed about 7 a.m.,
mod. S.S.E., E.S.E., S.W., and N. breezes respectively. On
March 1st, at 9 a.m., two Robins and two Magpies, fresh N.W.
breeze, gloomy and showery, with snow. Autumn: On Oct.
28th, at Morecambe Bay, "a female Redbreast" in vicinity,
10 a.m., mod. N.N.E. breeze.</p>

<p>Nightingale, <i>Daulias luscinia</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring: On April
22nd, at Burnham, "heard at 5 a.m. for first time, being one
day later than last year, and in the very same spot."&mdash;W.
Lewis, P. K.</p>

<p>Goldcrest, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>, Koch; Chiffchaff, <i>Phylloscopus
collybita</i>, Vieill.&mdash;Spring: On May 2nd, at Nash E., 200
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">-62-</span>
Chiffchaffs were counted from 1 a.m. to sunrise, light E. air,
haze; 196 were killed. Autumn: On Oct. 26th, at South Stack,
a few Goldcrests from 12 to 4 a.m., one killed, gentle E. breeze.
The same day, at Morecambe Bay, one (cock) Goldcrest flew on
board, struck the deck-house and fell on deck, but was not
killed; and at Nash, the same day, 12 to 18 Chiffchaffs passed
at 4 a.m., and 6 were killed, light E.N.E. breeze, rain. On Dec.
31st, at 3 a.m., one Goldcrest struck at South Stack, light S.W.
breeze, cloudy. From Flatholm, Mr. Dale reports "Gold crested
Wrens and Chiffchaffs not so numerous as usual in the autumn."
Taking the whole family of the <span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span>, the chief movement as
observed on the west coast occurred the latter end of October:
this, we find, agrees with a general movement of the family
noticed on both coasts of Scotland, and also a rush from E. to
W. observed on the English east coast. On Oct. 14th was
"a whole gale" from the E., after which the winds continued
E. and S.E. to the end of the month&mdash;the force when noted
ranging from 2 to 7. With the exception of the Redwing, and
excepting the note of Blackbirds and of Robins seen at Allonby,
there has scarcely been an instance recorded of any of the
family seen throughout November. There is an absolute absence
of Fieldfares, and the scarcity of the family generally is remarked
on from many stations. Thus, from Allonby, Mr. Thompson
writes (Nov., 1881), "No Fieldfares seen in this part, which is
very unusual." At Skerries, of Blackbirds, Thrushes, Fieldfares,
&amp;c., "very few are now seen." At Lundy, "till January,"
Mr. Parsons writes, "we had no birds on the islands, only now
and then a Blackbird or Thrush." At Usk, Blackbird and
Thrush seen occasionally. And from Nash E., Mr. Nicholas, P.K.,
writes in October, "Blackbirds and Thrushes have been very
scarce since the gale and snowstorm of Jan. 18th last," and "not
one Thrush has been seen here since January." Note:&mdash;At
Bardsey, however, Mr. Bowen says of Blackbirds, Grey-birds (?),
Jackdaws, House and <i>Common (?)</i> Sparrows, and Starlings, that
they are resident. Does this mean that they are seen all the
year round; even so, is there no increase and decrease in the
number noticeable, and if so, when? Are <i>Grey</i>-birds the Grey-backed
Crows? What is the difference between "House" and
"Common" Sparrow? Does the latter mean the Hedgesparrow,
or is one the Tree Sparrow? If there be any doubt, a specimen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">-63-</span>
or the skin, head, or wings sent through the post would serve to
identify the species.</p>

<p>Wren, <i>Troglodytes parvulus</i>, Koch.&mdash;Autumn: First notice
Sept. 4th, at Skerries, at 2 a.m., several struck the glass and

ship in the forenoon. On Oct. 5th, one flying S. by E., mod.
N.E. by N. breeze; and on 7th, one flying N.W., light S.S.W.
breeze. This is the last recorded, except at Allonby, where,

parts."</p>

1882, "two pairs of Sea Larks" are reported, with the note,
"they remain here for the winter" (Is the Rock Pipit meant by
Sea Lark? If a specimen were procured and sent by post it
might easily be identified; or is it the Ringed Dotterel?).</p>

times of the day, mod. N.N.E. breeze. On 20th, at Allonby,
flocks. At Skerries they are said to remain all the year. (But
do all remain all the year? What about the young? Is there
no movement noticeable at any time of the year?)</p>

At Morecambe, first instance, Sept. 18th, one flying about the
ship, followed by a Skua; and on 25th, two flying S.S.E., gentle
N.W. breeze. At Menai they are mentioned as being more
plentiful in August and September; and at Bideford, in September,
hundreds at the mussel-beds with Oystercatchers, &amp;c. At
Nash, Oct. 6th, eight passed N.W. at 1.30 p.m., light E. breeze.
At Morecambe, on 19th, three passed S.W., strong S.E. gale.
And at Skerries, on 18th, Curlews flying about the island all day,
mod. S.E. breeze; on 23rd they were seen all day, light E.S.E.
breeze, clear. At Usk, throughout the winter, large flocks seen
on the sands when tide in, and these remained about till March,
3882.</p>

<p>Arctic Tern, <i>Sterna macrura</i>, Naum.; Lesser Tern, <i>S. minuta</i>,
Linn.&mdash;At Nash, June 24th to 28th, a large number of Sea
Swallows (with Curlews) passed S.W. from sunrise to 1 p.m.,
mod. N.W. to S. breeze, rain. At Skerries, May 1st to September,
innumerable quantities of Arctic Terns or Sea Swallows (come to
breed, leaving when young able to fly). At Bideford, Sept. 17th,
a Sea Swallow, 10 p.m., struck the lantern, and was taken alive,
fresh S. breeze, mist. On Sept. 27th, at Morecambe, three
Lesser Terns passed with two Titlarks, flying N.N.W., gentle
N.W. by N. breeze.</p>

<p>Gull, <i>Larus</i>.&mdash;Spring: At Great Castle Head, in January up
to 20th, Gulls flew by. At Bull Point, from 11th to 26th, Sea
Gulls (grey), flying rather high, S.W., with mod. breeze from
N.W. At Nash, on 9th, a small flock of Gulls passed N.,
11 a.m., light E.N.E. breeze. At Great Castle Head, March
14th and 18th, four and six Gulls flying S.S.E. and S.W.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">-73-</span>
Autumn: At Nash, on Aug. 30th, a large flock of Gulls passed
N.W. at 7 a.m., gentle E.N.E. breeze. At South Stack Gulls
are reported as remaining till Aug. 29th. At Bideford hundreds
of Common Gulls seen in September. At Bull Point, on Sept.
16th, a Black-backed Gull passed W.S.W., 10.15 a.m.; on 17th,
at Morecambe, continuous flocks of Gulls, Black-headed, Grey,
and different species. Thence to Oct. 19th. Flocks of Common
Gulls and different species are constantly recorded; winds from
N.N.E. to S.E. by S. (never directly E. or N., nor indeed N. of
E.); greatest number Sept. 19th to 22nd inclusive. At Nash,
Oct. 13th, a very large flock of Gulls and Crows seen inland from
8 a.m. to 4 p.m., mod. W. breeze, very clear. The same on
27th, gentle E.N.E. breeze, mist. A great number passsed up
and down the Channel from August to October, about sunrise
flying N. and at sunset S. At Allonby, Nov. 14th, it is "noted for
some time past a great quantity of Kittiwakes been on the coast."
At Skerries also an unusual number of Kittiwakes this year; a
few Gulls all the year. At Usk large flocks of Gulls seen occasionally
through the window. At Bardsey Gulls resident; and at
Menai always seen.</p>

<p>Skua, <i>Stercorarius catarrhactes</i>, Linn.&mdash;The only records from
Morecambe on Sept. 18th, one following a flock of Gulls, and
again on 19th and 20th; several on 22nd, in vicinity all day;
23rd, a dozen going W., 1.30 p.m., gloomy and misty; on 25th,
29th, and 30th a good many seen. In October, one seen on 23rd
chasing Gulls; on 8th, one going S., gentle E.N.E. breeze; the
latest notice on 11th, a few chasing Gulls.</p>

<p>Petrel, <i>Procellaria pelagica</i>, Linn.&mdash;On Sept. 23rd, at Godrevy,
one struck, 9.30 p.m. (not killed), mod. S.S.E. breeze, clear.
At Morecambe, Nov. 22nd, a Stormy Petrel flying W., 2.30 p.m.,
mod. W. gale. At St. Tudwal's, Jan. 8th, 1882, four Stormy
Petrels rested under lee of rocks, 3.30 p.m., mod. W. gale.</p>

<p>Razorbill, <i>Alca torda</i>, Linn.&mdash;From South Stack we hear
Razorbills left after breeding in the beginning of August, At St.
Bees the beginning of this year (1882), a bird was picked up dead
on the shore, which, from the description and a sketch made by
Mr. Pizey, P.K., I identified as a Razorbill.</p>

<p>Guillemot, <i>Lomvia troile</i>, Linn.&mdash;At South Stack they are
mentioned in same note as Razorbills as leaving in beginning of
August. At Holyhead, Sept. 1st, large flocks of Guillemots and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>
Puffins, fresh N.E. breeze, clear. At Milford, on same date, it
is noted that "several during the past week struck the lantern
windows at night; they annually do so at this time and no other."
At Morecambe, Sept. 20th, a great number of Divers (? Guillemots),
with Gulls and Skuas, and so to 26th, when a few Divers
throughout the day. At Hartland Point diving birds were
observed near the shore in January, 1882. At Skerries Guillemots
and Puffins are reported as remaining nearly the year
round. (But if not all the year, when do they leave and when
return? Could this be noticed for next year's report?)</p>

<p>Puffin, <i>Fratercula arctica</i>, Linn.&mdash;At Holyhead, Sept. 1st,
large flocks with Guillemots. At Morecambe, Sept. 28th, small
flocks of Gulls and Puffins continuous, and, on Oct. 1st to 28rd,
flocks with Gulls seen in vicinity.</p>

<p>Birds unknown.&mdash;At Hartland Point, Oct. 27th, grey bird at
midnight struck the lantern, fresh E. breeze. At Bardsey Mr.
Bowen says grey birds, &amp;c., are resident. Are Grey Crows
meant? At Air, Oct. 29th, flocks of birds unknown passed before
daylight, mod. N.E. breeze. At Scilly, Oct. 18th, a few migrants
later part of the month. At Morecambe, Oct. 20th, small flocks
of small birds going E.S.E., 8.30 a.m., strong S.E. by E. breeze,
clear, a little misty.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Additional Remarks.</span></p>

<p>Holyhead, Menai, and St. Bees are reported as unfavourable
stations for observation. From Bull Point Mr. Knott writes:&mdash;"Very
few birds to be seen. It is a north aspect; more to be
seen with a south aspect." And from Great Castle Head Mr.
Spicer writes:&mdash;"This being an inland lighthouse there is
scarcely a bird to be seen for days, and then by chance you might
see some away in the fields."</p>

<p>Most of the stations report scarcity in comparison with other
years, as South Stack, Lundy, Caldy, Usk, Burnham, and Trevose
Head; the decrease appears to be ascribed to the mildness of the
season. Whether this be the real or the main cause of a like
scarcity or not from the following stations may be an open
question; but I give the opinion of the observers, and they do
not speak of it as the record of this year's observations alone,
<i>viz.</i>, Longships, from which Mr. Jones writes:&mdash;"Very few cases
of birds coming against our lantern since (of late years) the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">-75-</span>
light is red towards the shore." From Burnham it is reported
"Birds very rarely strike, the lantern glass being only eight feet by
four feet." And from Skerries report I extract the following:&mdash;"There
is a small quantity of birds in comparison with years
prior to introduction of fog-horn (see also Rep. 1880, p. 119).
In thick and foggy weather during November and February great
quantities were always seen, chiefly Starlings, with Blackbirds,
Thrushes, Wheatears, Larks, &amp;c. On one occasion I saw our
lantern gallery full, and at the base of the tower the quantity
killed necessitated the use next morning of the wheelbarrow to
remove them to the garden for manure. On one occasion a
monster pie, made by workmen employed here, contained two
hundred Larks, besides other smaller birds. But since the fog-horn
has been sounded in thick weather birds coming to the light
have been few, though many seen and heard in the air."&mdash;H. Knott.</p>

<p>From the same station Mr. Garret, P.K., writes:&mdash;"These
birds (Sea Swallows, which breed on the island) seem to take no
notice of the fog-horn, while others, such as Starlings, Blackbirds,
Thrushes, Larks, &amp;c., keep off while the horn is sounding,
so that very few are seen round the lantern now, while formerly,
in thick or misty weather during February and November, the
lantern-gallery would be full of birds; each on striking would
drop into the gallery and remain till daylight, when, if not too
much injured, they would fly; but with strong winds a great
number, chiefly Starlings, would be killed."</p>

<p>It is easy to believe that the hideous sound of a fog-horn, till
the birds get used to it, will keep them at a distance. That birds
recognise landmarks cannot, I think, be doubted, and possibly a
complete change in colour of a light they have grown accustomed
to may for a time make them suspicious of it. I think that if a
light be placed in a new, and not altogether unfavourable, situation,
birds will be attracted to it, because, though not yet accustomed
to see it in that spot, they will recognise it as a resting-place
and sign of land. From some light-keepers I have heard
that years ago (the lighthouse then not long erected) the slaughter
among birds was much greater than now. Of course the nature
of the season would partly account for this, but I think also that
the unaccustomed light might attract many a weary wanderer to
an untimely death. That birds profit by experience cannot, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">-76-</span>
think, be doubted, and I expect that the unrestrained destruction
of them along a particular route will gradually effect a change in
their ways. I believe that the scarcity now for some years
generally noticed may be due in a measure to the ruthless destruction
met with at certain points on the Continent in their line
of annual flight.</p>

<p>Fresh instances are constantly occurring which show the
relation between the movements of birds and the state of the
weather. In connection with this point I quote the words of
Mr. Nicholas, keeper at Nash E., who writes:&mdash;"I've noticed
whenever there is a lot of Gulls and Crows inland, it indicates a
gale. I first noticed this Oct. 13th; on 14th there was a whole
gale. I have since that date observed the same thing before
every gale."</p>

<p>The prevailing winds on this coast were:&mdash;From August to
Sept. 17th, easterly; thence, to Sept. 29th, gentle to mod. W.;
thence, to Oct. 8th, E., <i>viz.</i>, mod. S.E. and E. to 5th, then with
more or less of N. On and after 9th, W. till 14th, with touch of
N. and strong; on 16th a whole gale, E., thence, to 24th, S.E.,
strong breezes; after which, to the end of the month, E. and
N.E.</p>

<p>Birds have not been noticed in such large flocks as last year,
and there have been but faint traces of rushes. No rare birds
are reported.</p>

<p>The most decided and general movement took place between
Oct. 16th and 27th; after October, except among the <span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;</span>,
the occurrences being very scarce. The chief occurrences in
September were Wrens, Wagtails, Swallows, and Finches; and
in October Starlings, Sky Larks, and the <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>In the autumnal migration the difference in date of arrival,
as compared with last year, may be worth marking. So far as
our records show the Redwing was first noticed a month later,
the Blackbird six weeks, and Thrush three weeks, the Sky Lark
a month, Goldcrest twelve days, Wheatear and Greenfinch five
days, the Golden Plover fourteen days. The following are recorded
earlier: the Meadow Pipit by two weeks. Swallow seventeen
days, Starling nineteen days, Wagtail, Chaffinch, and Linnet
a few days. Of the <span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;</span>, Ducks are noticed a few days earlier,
Geese considerably later.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say anything positive as to direction of flight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span>
which is too seldom noted; in case of the <span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span> scarcely at all.
This in part is owing to many of the instances occurring at night
in the dark. So far as I can make out all birds here follow the
coast line very clearly. The main direction, to judge from the
scant records in September, was southerly; in October one or two
directly E.; the rest E., with more or less of N. With a few
marked exceptions the movement has in almost every species
been noticed at the southerly stations first, and appears gradually
to have extended N. Whether this be accidental or a rule can
only be decided by continued and careful observations from all
the stations. Of the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> and water-birds the most frequent
records are in October, and the direction S.W. and S., sometimes
S.E.; but between Dec. 2nd to 11th, at Morecambe Bay, they
passed N.W. After 11th to end of December S.W.</p>

<p>The best filled returns have this year been received from
Morecambe Bay, Skerries, and Nash E. These observers have
also given the fullest information; Nash especially in showing
the direction of flight, a matter concerning which information is
very desirable.</p>

<p>As to the circumstances under which the movement takes
place, as affecting the flight or the striking of birds, &amp;c., the
reports bear out the conclusions previously expressed. Last year
Mr. Bowen (Bardsey) referred to flight of birds before the wind
(Rep., p. 119); Mr. Knott now writes from Skerries, "Many
birds are killed in strong winds, as they then fly with greater
force, and almost invariably in the same direction as the wind."
Still the evidence shows that birds, as a rule, migrate with the
wind on the shoulder, and not strong. When they do fly with
the wind, and the wind strong, it is probably because they have
been taken by surprise, and are unable to save themselves.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Printed</span> schedules were forwarded to forty light stations
around the coast. Thirty stations replied by returning the
schedules wholly or partially filled with daily entries, or by
sending letters remarking on the absence of migratory birds or
on their general movements.</p>

<p>To the Commissioners of Irish Lights we are indebted for
the facilities afforded us in conducting this enquiry. We have to
thank Captain Boxer, R.N., Inspector of Irish Lights, for his
friendly co-operation&mdash;his knowledge of the coast and intimate
acquaintance with the light stations rendered his advice and
assistance especially valuable.</p>

<p>On the whole the returns have been as satisfactory as was
anticipated; some of the schedules have been carefully filled,
and although others contain very few entries, this is to be
accounted for rather by the absence of migratory birds than by
any unwillingness on the part of the light-keepers to assist us.
When we remember their many and various duties, and that the
observations are entirely voluntary, there is reason to be well
contented with the first attempt of this kind to collect information
on the Irish coast; and we return our sincere thanks to all the
lighthouse-keepers who have given their time and attention to
the subject.</p>

<p>The entries in all the schedules have been collected under
each day of the month as they occur; this method of arrangement
shows the movements of all birds as entered on each
day, and the number of observations on that day. The effect
of the weather on the migratory movement can thus be
studied, and the general direction of flight of the various species
compared.</p>

<p>The daily weather-charts show last winter to have been
exceptional in the number and violence of the cyclonic disturbances,
which moved generally in a north-easterly direction
along our west coasts; but the entries in the schedules
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span>
are too few to generalise or draw any conclusions regarding
the influence of the successive storms on the migratory movement.</p>

<p>A table showing the days on which entries were made in the
schedules has been drawn up in, the hope that, if the extent of
the migratory movement on any particular day varied with the
number of entries, some inference could be drawn; but here also
generalisation is premature.</p>

<p>In a few returns names are given to birds from which it is
not easy to identify the species, and occasionally there is reason
to fear one species has been mistaken for another. In all cases,
however, the name entered in the schedule has been allowed to stand
without comment.</p>

<p>The general remarks of the light-keepers are given consecutively,
and as contributions to the Ornithology of the lighthouses
they are interesting.</p>

<p>A table showing the number of birds striking each lantern,
the number of daily entries in each return, the number of species
of birds mentioned in each schedule in the daily entries, the
height of each lantern above high-water mark, and its approximate
distance from the mainland is given.</p>

<p>Whatever results are obtained from this investigation, they
will only be arrived at by patiently collecting observations for
some years. If the light-keepers continue to assist us, this can
readily be done&mdash;without their co-operation annually we are
helpless.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks of Light-Keepers.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Fastnet.</i>&mdash;"Very few birds came on or passed the rock
this winter. It must be in consequence of bad weather on this
coast. No sea birds build nests near this station."&mdash;John
Tottenham.</p>

<p>2. <i>Galley Head.</i>&mdash;"This is one of the worst stations I have
been at for birds; in fact we think it rare to see any only those
that are natives of the place. This year they are very scarce.
The Starling has not come down to us from the mountains yet."&mdash;John Whelan.</p>

<p>3. <i>Old Head, Kinsale.</i>&mdash;"No birds, only the above (<i>i. e.</i>, five
Golden-crested Wrens on Oct. 24th, and several flocks of Lapwings
on Dec. 12th) have appeared in the vicinity this season.
The Gannet usually proceeds to the eastward in August and
September, and flies westward from January to March. The
Guillemots, Razorbills, Cormorants, Kittiwake, and Herring Gulls
all arrive here to breed in March, and depart in August and September."&mdash;John Dunleary.</p>

<p>4. <i>Mine Head.</i>&mdash;"Birds of all descriptions were not so scarce
at this station for the last seven years as during the year 1881."&mdash;Joseph Hammond.</p>

<p>5. <i>Coningbeg Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"There were no birds about the
station in the month of December, or up to the 20th of January,
with the exception of a few Sea Gulls each day."&mdash;Patrick
Cullen.</p>

<p>6. <i>Barrels Rock Light-ship.</i>&mdash;General remarks none, but a
full schedule of daily entries.&mdash;Joseph Oxford.</p>

<p>7. <i>Tuskar.</i>&mdash;General remarks, none. A full schedule.&mdash;Richard
Hamilton.</p>

<p>8. <i>Arklow, South, Light-ship.</i>&mdash;General remarks, none. A full
schedule.&mdash;William Shea.</p>

<p>9. <i>Wicklow Head.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>10. <i>Kish Bank Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"Less birds passed the station
this winter than ever. No birds have been killed by striking our
lantern for some years."&mdash;William Daly.</p>

<p>11. <i>Howth Baily.</i>&mdash;General remarks, none.&mdash;Joseph Brownell.</p>

<p>12. <i>Rockabill.</i>&mdash;"Sept. 1st. Received schedule; a great
number of different species of Gulls in vicinity of Rock, and on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">-83-</span>
smaller rock called the Bill, from about the second week in
August to the third week in September, when they almost entirely
disappeared. Cannot name the species; there were also Puffins,
and occasionally two or three Gannets. This is an annual
occurrence, but not always at the same time. Birds have been
unusually scarce this season. Since stormy weather set in early
in November no birds have been about the Rock, except a few
Sand Larks, and a few Gulls, Puffins, and Cormorants flying
about this and the smaller rock during a storm."&mdash;William
Dunne.</p>

<p>13. <i>Copeland Island.</i>&mdash;"There were no birds struck the light
this winter owing to the strong gales which prevailed."&mdash;Henry
Williams.</p>

<p>14. <i>The Maidens.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>15. <i>Rathlin Island.</i>&mdash;A second schedule partly filled. Remark:&mdash;"The
Sea Parrot begins to arrive for the purpose of
cleaning out its nest on March 17th, and then goes away until
the 1st of April, when the different species of sea birds commence
to arrive for the season. They begin to go away about 1st of
August, and finally disappear by the end of the month."&mdash;John
A. Murray.</p>

<p>16. <i>Innishtrahull.</i>&mdash;"September, Gannet daily, 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. Curlew daily. The 'Grey' Gull, 'Little' Gull, Black-backed
or Royal Gull, Common Gull, and Grey Crow remain on
the island all the year. Gulls nidify on the rock called Torr near
the island; Grey Crows nidify on the island. In November
flocks of twelve to twenty Starlings daily. Owing to this
winter being very stormy little birds of any sort visited the
island. During the months of January and February, 1881,
a great number of Woodcock and Snipe were killed here."&mdash;W.
H. James.</p>

<p>17. <i>Dunree Head.</i>&mdash;Daily entry, none. Remark:&mdash;"I beg
to state there are no migrations of birds to be seen at this station,
except Cormorants; they remain the year, round, also a small
number of Sea Gulls. No other birds resort or pass this station."&mdash;John Stapleton.</p>

<p>18. <i>Lough Swilly.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>19. <i>Tory Island.</i>&mdash;"The Petrel, Raven, Common Sandpiper,
Common Guillemot, Black Guillemot, Razorbill, Diver, Puffin,
Cormorant, Kittiwake, Common Gull, Herring Gull breed on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span>
east end of the island, and are annually decreasing. Breed in
larger numbers on Horn Head. Have not observed birds
migrating. No birds struck the lantern this winter. Have not
observed the Gannet or other sea birds taking a continuous
flight."&mdash;Thomas Sweeney.</p>

<p>20. <i>Arranmore.</i>&mdash;"Barnacle Geese generally commence to
come from the north on the 15th or 16th of October in flocks
averaging four to eighty, that being the most counted in one
flock. They pass at intervals of from two to twelve hours both
day and night until the end of the month, when they cease.
They commence to appear again on the 10th or 12th of April,
coming from south, but in larger flocks and shorter intervals.
No other species but Gannet and Barnacle resort this locality."&mdash;John Walsh.</p>

<p>21. <i>Rathlin O'Birne.</i>&mdash;"Sky Larks, Titlarks, and Stonechats
continued arriving in numbers of two, four, and six until about
the 10th of May. At that time there were about twenty of each
species on the island. They nidificated on the island. By the
10th of September the Sky Larks had departed; by the 20th of
October the Titlarks had departed; by the 16th of November the
Stonechats had departed. None of these species were observed
after that date until Dec. 22nd, when five or six Titlarks returned,
and are here still. On June the 3rd twelve to fourteen Common
Terns alighted on a small island outside lighthouse, nidificated,
and left about Aug. 1st. Sea Gulls nidificated on small island
above referred to, and one pair of 'sepoys' on this island. In
July several pairs of Skua Gulls passed, and some remained in
vicinity. Curlew frequent this island from 1st of May until 1st
of October. They come at night time, and leave the following
day generally. Unless with frosty and snowy weather, Starlings,
Snipes, Woodcocks, Blackbirds, or Thrushes do not visit. Sandpipers
and Jack Curlew are about the shores all the year round.
No Gannets seen since Nov. 8th. Sea Gulls in vicinity all the
year. Barnacle continue coming and departing until about
Feb. 15th. No Starling or Snipe visited since last winter."&mdash;Joseph Hill.</p>

<p>22. <i>Killybegs.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>23. <i>Oyster Island, North.</i>&mdash;"From the middle of October to
the last week in November several large flocks of Gulls were to
be seen in the bay after herrings, principally of the Kittiwake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">-85-</span>
species, with a few large Grey Gulls and an occasional Royal or
Black-backed Gull; also large flocks of Puffins, which all left
when the herrings disappeared. Large flocks of Barnacle and
Wigeon arrive in this locality early in October, and remain
until latter end of March, passing to and fro to feeding-ground
according to tide, besides those going further south."&mdash;John
Young.</p>

<p>24. <i>Broadhaven.</i>&mdash;"The above (<i>i.e.</i>, Barnacle, Wild Geese,
Wild Duck, and Solan Geese) are the only description of birds
seen in the locality; they are generally passing inland, and at
times alight near the lighthouse to feed on the swampy land.
No Sea Gulls build near this station, but a few come into the
harbour in the summer months after the fry of fish."&mdash;Joseph
Williams.</p>

<p>25. <i>Eagle Island, East.</i>&mdash;No entry in schedule. Remark:&mdash;"Up
to the present no birds are visible, only on occasions when
fish are seen on the surface of the water, and these are Gannets
and large-sized Gulls. I have not noticed any kind of birds pass
or rest at this station in their flight of migration."&mdash;Robert
Redmond.</p>

<p>26. <i>Eagle Island, West.</i>&mdash;No entry in schedule. Remark:&mdash;"This
island is very small, and the adjacent shores being all bog
for miles inland very few birds alight on island. The Stonechatter
is to be seen here all the year round. In May the sea-fowl
come round the island in great numbers; as a rule they go
gradually to the south, following shoals of fish, and very few are
to be seen during the winter months. To-day (Jan. 15th, 1882)
I have seen a few Gannets and Sea Gulls flying about. No birds
have struck the lantern since my arrival at this station eighteen
months since."&mdash;Mathew Healy.</p>

<p>27. <i>Black Rock (Mayo).</i>&mdash;No daily entry, but schedule filled
by following general remarks:&mdash;"Gannets seen passing south all
the year round, most seen in calm weather, ten to twenty in each
flight. Puffins from April 15th to Aug. 15th; build on the Rock.
Cormorants here all the year round; build on the Rock. Kittiwake
Gulls build on an island three miles away; also Royal
Gulls. Small Gulls, commonly called 'Wheelons,' build on the
Rock. Barnacles here from October to March. Two 'Falcon
Hawks' build on an island three miles away; here all the year
round. Two 'Sparrowhawks' seen in the mornings. Rooks, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">-86-</span>
flocks of 100 to 500, mostly seen in snow and frosty weather.
Starlings from September to March, morning and evening, 1000
to 5000 in a flock, seen with all winds, mostly in frosty weather;
hundreds killed against lantern. 'Missel Thrushes' from November
to March, 50 to 100 in each flock, most in frosty weather;
seen at all hours; a large number killed. Snipe from November
to March in flocks of two to four, in frost and snow; some
killed. Woodcocks from November to March in frost and snow;
some killed. Curlews, twenty to thirty in a flock, from daylight
till dark; seen all the year round. Wrens seen very seldom in
the spring. Blackbirds only seen in frosty weather; some killed
by striking lantern. 'Titmouses' seen in all weathers; build
on the Rock. Stormy Petrels from March to September, at all
hours of the night; build on the Rock. Larks in flocks of 100
to 300, only seen in frosty weather; a large number killed by
striking glass. I have seen some strange birds rest here on their
passage to the mainland, but do not know their names. I have
seen a Hoopoe on one occasion rest here. There has been
a species of Sea Gull of a deep cream-colour on the coast last
August, supposed to be a North American bird. I have seen
large flights of Rooks rest here after coming in from the sea in
a S.W. direction, which seemed so much fatigued that they would
fall over after resting, and remain to be caught."&mdash;Martin
Kennedy.</p>

<p>28. <i>Blacksod Point.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>29. <i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;"The following varieties of birds build
their nests round the cliffs here; they come on the 1st of April
and leave about the 20th of August:&mdash;Guillemots, Razorbills,
Puffins, Kittiwakes."&mdash;James Reilly.</p>

<p>30. <i>Slyne Head (North).</i>&mdash;"The 'Purr' is the only sea-bird
that breeds near this station. They arrive in April and depart
in August. The arrival of birds to this island during the past
autumn and winter was very few in comparison with other years,
and the only reason I can assign for it is that we had very little
snow. During the snow of 1880 we had large flocks of Starlings,
Thrushes, and Blackbirds arriving daily from the east."&mdash;John Gillan.</p>

<p>31. <i>Slyne Head (South).</i>&mdash;No general remarks. Schedule
partly filled.&mdash;William Callaghan.</p>

<p>32. <i>Arran Island, North.</i>&mdash;"The only birds seen in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">-87-</span>
vicinity of this station since July are the Gannet, the Royal or
Black-backed Gull, and the Common Gull. They do not breed
on this island, as it is low and flat. The Gulls breed on the cliffs
of the large island of Arran and cliffs of the Co. Clare. Do not
know dates of arrival or departure. The Gannets and Gulls that
visit this station come from the direction of the Co. Clare, remain
during the day, and return in the evening. No flocks seen after
Nov. 7th."&mdash;John Kelly.</p>

<p>33. <i>Straw Island.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>34. <i>Arran Island, South.</i>&mdash;"Have never known less birds
strike the lantern."&mdash;Francis Ryan.</p>

<p>35. <i>Loop Head.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>36. <i>Samphire Island.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>37. <i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p>38. <i>Valentia.</i>&mdash;"I have been at this station 4&frac12; years, and
have never seen any birds migrating or resorting this locality
except sea-birds, such as Gannet, Puffin, Cormorants, &amp;c. They
are not very numerous, and seldom visit except from August to
the end of October. Very few land-birds visit here, except in
severe frosts and snow in winter; then the Starling, Thrush,
Blackbird, Lark, &amp;c., come down from the mountains. Hundreds
of Starlings, Thrushes, and Curlews died last January in this
locality by severe frost and snow. There are not any birds
strike this lantern. Very few strike land-lights, but on the South
Maiden lighthouse I have seen hundreds of Starlings, Thrushes,
and Blackbirds strike and kill themselves in one night, and
frequently Snipe and Woodcock. On the Tuskar Rock lighthouse
I have counted twelve hundred killed in one night, and hundreds
more fell into the sea that we did not get. At Rockabill lighthouse
also I have got great numbers killed, and frequently four
and six Teal or small duck, and Snipe and Woodcock. I have
not seen since I came to this station one Wild Duck or Goose,
nor any flock of migrating birds. I have kept a good look-out
for the last two months, and have not seen any birds except a
few Gannets and Sea Gulls."&mdash;Thomas McKenna.</p>

<p>39. <i>Skelligs.</i>&mdash;No entry in schedule. Remark:&mdash;"The only
birds observed at present in this locality are a few Gannets and
Sea Gulls occasionally."&mdash;Henry Gardiner.</p>

<p>40. <i>Calf Rock.</i> No reply. Destroyed by storm in Nov., 1881.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
